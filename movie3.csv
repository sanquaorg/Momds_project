"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"
"","","For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059579/?ref_=tt_urv","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion.

Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

"","","Perfection","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4751992/?ref_=tt_urv","Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere.

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"

There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change.

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

"","","#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2774909/?ref_=tt_urv","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"","","This Movie Has Haunted My Life...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414680/?ref_=tt_urv","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere.

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun.

That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"","","This Movie Has Haunted My Life...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414680/?ref_=tt_urv","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience.","","","","10"
"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3050594/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","A flawless masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2277001/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.
The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!
The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience.","","","","10"
"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3050594/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' to be called the greatest movie of all time is a fair judgment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2717398/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"

As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.
I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.
I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.
There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.
Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE BEST EVER!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8014667/?ref_=tt_urv","AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"","","This Movie Has Haunted My Life...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414680/?ref_=tt_urv","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere.

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun.

That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.
The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!
The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

Give ""The Godfather"" 10 stars.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1971466/?ref_=tt_urv","I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.
I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.
I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.
There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.
Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE BEST EVER!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8014667/?ref_=tt_urv","AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!
So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!","","","","10"

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

"","","Regarded a classic for good reason, Coppola's crime epic is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4057923/?ref_=tt_urv","Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"
"","","Timeless Mafia Film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2860842/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.
A masterpiece.

"","","Cinematic Classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1993941/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)
Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.
Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

"","","Best film ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283184/?ref_=tt_urv","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"
"","","One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2989297/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.
Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"

"","","Very Average Film. Very Overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2874654/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.
However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.
Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.
7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.

It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.
Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?
Worth a watch but don't get too excited.

An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"
"","","For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059579/?ref_=tt_urv","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"
"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123143/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

"","","Perfection","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4751992/?ref_=tt_urv","Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3050594/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.
The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.
The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.
The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","The American Dream & One of the Greatest Films Ever Made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123563/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it.

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!
The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.
I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.
There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.
Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"
"","","Timeless Mafia Film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2860842/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

"","","Best film ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283184/?ref_=tt_urv","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"

But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"
"","","This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249280/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.
Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Number 1 - 1972

Top 5 - All Time
An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123093/?ref_=tt_urv","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.
For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.
This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.
My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.","","","","9"

I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.

"","","A novel of images","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190343/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.
""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).
""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.
""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.
""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...
A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.","","","","9"

"","","America's Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425741/?ref_=tt_urv","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.
It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.
This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.
But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.
The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.
There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.
""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.
One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.
The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.
Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.
In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.
Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.
Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.","","","","10"

Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!

"","","Showy and shallow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164485/?ref_=tt_urv","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.","","","","6"
"","","Almost Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224527/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.

"","","Let's Get Down To The Facts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158700/?ref_=tt_urv","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.

"","","Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182387/?ref_=tt_urv","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".
This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).
With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.
It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.
All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.","","","","10"

"","","Marlon Brando at his best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347112/?ref_=tt_urv","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.
But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.
But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.","","","","10"

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"
"","","For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059579/?ref_=tt_urv","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"
"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123143/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun.

That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE BEST EVER!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8014667/?ref_=tt_urv","AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor!

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"

Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.
Enjoy, 9/10.","","","","10"
"","","Best film ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283184/?ref_=tt_urv","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"
"","","One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2989297/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.
Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"
"","","This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249280/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.
Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Number 1 - 1972

An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123093/?ref_=tt_urv","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.
For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.
This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.
My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.","","","","9"

"","","A novel of images","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190343/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.
""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).
""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.
""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.
""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...
A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.","","","","9"

"","","America's Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425741/?ref_=tt_urv","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.
It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.
This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.
But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.
The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.
There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.
""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.
One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.
The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.
Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.
In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.
Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.
Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.","","","","10"
"","","The best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123412/?ref_=tt_urv","I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!

"","","Showy and shallow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164485/?ref_=tt_urv","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.","","","","6"
"","","Almost Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224527/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.

"","","Let's Get Down To The Facts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158700/?ref_=tt_urv","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.

"","","Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182387/?ref_=tt_urv","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".
This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).
With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.
It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.
All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.","","","","10"

"","","Marlon Brando at his best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347112/?ref_=tt_urv","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.
But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.
But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.","","","","10"

"","","The definitive mob movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3225734/?ref_=tt_urv","Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.","","","","10"
"","","Definitely not a masterpece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473289/?ref_=tt_urv","I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.

"","","Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6820406/?ref_=tt_urv","I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.
This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.

"","","List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123426/?ref_=tt_urv","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.
You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.
I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.","","","","3"
"","","Its good but Geez....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123788/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.
I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.
Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.

"","","And so it begins","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2748198/?ref_=tt_urv","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.
Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.
The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)","","","","10"

To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is.

Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.

"","","Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1165554/?ref_=tt_urv","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.
All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.
And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.
The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.
The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.
Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.
Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.","","","","4"
"","","Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239324/?ref_=tt_urv","No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.
There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.

"","","a great work for art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6081304/?ref_=tt_urv","A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble. A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)

"","","Great film making in a moral vacuum.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123487/?ref_=tt_urv","A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.
The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.
Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.
I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.
Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.
Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.
Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.
We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.
The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.
(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)
Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""
Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".
The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.
Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...","","","","9"

I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.
It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.

"","","Couldn't get any better than this...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3300234/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!","","","","10"
"","","Massively overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123460/?ref_=tt_urv","I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.
Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"
"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123143/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun.

That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE BEST EVER!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8014667/?ref_=tt_urv","AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor!

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"

Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.
Enjoy, 9/10.","","","","10"
"","","Best film ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283184/?ref_=tt_urv","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"
"","","One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2989297/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.
Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"
"","","This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249280/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.
Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Number 1 - 1972

An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123093/?ref_=tt_urv","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.
For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.
This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.
My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.","","","","9"

"","","A novel of images","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190343/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.
""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).
""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.
""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.
""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...
A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.","","","","9"

"","","America's Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425741/?ref_=tt_urv","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.
It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.
This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.
But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.
The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.
There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.
""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.
One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.
The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.
Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.
In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.
Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.
Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.","","","","10"
"","","The best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123412/?ref_=tt_urv","I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!

"","","Showy and shallow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164485/?ref_=tt_urv","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.","","","","6"
"","","Almost Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224527/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.

"","","Let's Get Down To The Facts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158700/?ref_=tt_urv","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.

"","","Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182387/?ref_=tt_urv","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".
This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).
With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.
It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.
All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.","","","","10"

"","","Marlon Brando at his best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347112/?ref_=tt_urv","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.
But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.
But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.","","","","10"

"","","The definitive mob movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3225734/?ref_=tt_urv","Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.","","","","10"
"","","Definitely not a masterpece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473289/?ref_=tt_urv","I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.

"","","Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6820406/?ref_=tt_urv","I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.
This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.

"","","List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123426/?ref_=tt_urv","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.
You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.
I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.","","","","3"
"","","Its good but Geez....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123788/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.
I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.
Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.

"","","And so it begins","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2748198/?ref_=tt_urv","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.
Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.
The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)","","","","10"

To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is.

Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.

"","","Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1165554/?ref_=tt_urv","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.
All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.
And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.
The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.
The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.
Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.
Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.","","","","4"
"","","Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239324/?ref_=tt_urv","No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.
There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.

"","","a great work for art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6081304/?ref_=tt_urv","A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble. A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)

"","","Great film making in a moral vacuum.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123487/?ref_=tt_urv","A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.
The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.
Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.
I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.
Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.
Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.
Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.
We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.
The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.
(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)
Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""
Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".
The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.
Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...","","","","9"

I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.

"","","Couldn't get any better than this...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3300234/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!","","","","10"
"","","Massively overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123460/?ref_=tt_urv","I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.
Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.

"","","Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1292892/?ref_=tt_urv","Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?
""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.
Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)
This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.
So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart.""","","","","1"
"","","Overrated, but still good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8655130/?ref_=tt_urv","I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.
The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.
The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.

"","","Never understood the hype","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8216203/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.

It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.
Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.
Hardly something worthy of praise.
The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.

"","","Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440905/?ref_=tt_urv","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.
But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.
I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.
Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.
Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.
A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.","","","","7"

"","","Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123212/?ref_=tt_urv","Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.
However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able.
Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one.
The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.","","","","10"

It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story? Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.

"","","An Excellent Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5538326/?ref_=tt_urv","Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States ""Don Vito Corleone"" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ""Connie Corleone"" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well.

"","","Best Crime Movies Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4658041/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).
The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.
He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972.","","","","10"
"","","Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3810813/?ref_=tt_urv","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.
MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.
I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.
Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.
What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.
THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.

"","","A tale of personal business","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1578477/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.","","","","9"

To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.
Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.
So sorry, this movie just isn't great.

"","","Best gangsters movie ever.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3304930/?ref_=tt_urv","This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's ""five families"". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.
If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century. Those who love good cinema must see this film.","","","","10"
"","","Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123275/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.
The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.
Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.
I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center.
I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.
Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.
Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.
I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".
I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger.","","","","1"

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"
"","","A Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440327/?ref_=tt_urv","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy","","","","10"

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"
"The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=tt_urv","An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123143/?ref_=tt_urv","","","","","10"
"","","Truly the Godfather of movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912946/?ref_=tt_urv","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s.

He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"

Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"
"","","""Leave the gun.

That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.
Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"
"","","The GODFATHER what else can i say ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8423622/?ref_=tt_urv","The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.
I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.
There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.
Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"
"","","Timeless Mafia Film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2860842/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"
"","","One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2989297/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.
Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"
"","","This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249280/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.
Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Number 1 - 1972
Number 1 - 1970s
Top 5 - All Time
An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123093/?ref_=tt_urv","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.
For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.
This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.
My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.","","","","9"

"","","A novel of images","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190343/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.
""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).
""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.
""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.
""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...
A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.","","","","9"

"","","America's Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425741/?ref_=tt_urv","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.
It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.
This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.
But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.
The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.
There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.
""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.
One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.
The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.
Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.
In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.
Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream.

"","","The best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123412/?ref_=tt_urv","I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!

"","","Showy and shallow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164485/?ref_=tt_urv","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.","","","","6"
"","","Almost Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224527/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.

"","","Let's Get Down To The Facts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158700/?ref_=tt_urv","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.

"","","Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182387/?ref_=tt_urv","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".
This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).
With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.
It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.
All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.","","","","10"

"","","Marlon Brando at his best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347112/?ref_=tt_urv","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.
But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.
But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.","","","","10"

"","","The definitive mob movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3225734/?ref_=tt_urv","Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.","","","","10"
"","","Definitely not a masterpece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473289/?ref_=tt_urv","I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.

"","","Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6820406/?ref_=tt_urv","I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.
This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.

"","","List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123426/?ref_=tt_urv","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.
You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.
I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.","","","","3"
"","","Its good but Geez....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123788/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.
I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.
Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.

"","","And so it begins","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2748198/?ref_=tt_urv","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.
Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.
The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)","","","","10"

To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is.

Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.

"","","Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1165554/?ref_=tt_urv","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.
All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.
And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.
The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.
The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.
Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.
Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.","","","","4"

Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.
There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.

The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.
Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.
I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.
Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.
Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.
Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.
We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.
The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.
(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)
Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""
Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".
The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.
Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...","","","","9"

I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.
I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.
It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.

"","","Couldn't get any better than this...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3300234/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!","","","","10"
"","","Massively overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123460/?ref_=tt_urv","I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.
Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.

"","","Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1292892/?ref_=tt_urv","Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?
""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.
Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)
This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.
So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart.""","","","","1"
"","","Overrated, but still good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8655130/?ref_=tt_urv","I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.
The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.
The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.

"","","Never understood the hype","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8216203/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.

It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.
Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.
Hardly something worthy of praise.
The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.

"","","Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440905/?ref_=tt_urv","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.
But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.
I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.
Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.
Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.
A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.","","","","7"

"","","Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123212/?ref_=tt_urv","Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.
However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able.
Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one.
The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.","","","","10"

It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story? Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.
This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system.

"","","Excellent movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123407/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever. Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia. James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens. A big accident. Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director. He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here. the acting was wonderful from everybody. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome.
Overall this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I watch it all of the time. Rating 11 out of 10. (Tied for favorite movie)

"","","An Excellent Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5538326/?ref_=tt_urv","Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States ""Don Vito Corleone"" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ""Connie Corleone"" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort.","","","","10"
"","","Best Crime Movies Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4658041/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).
The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.
He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972.","","","","10"
"","","Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3810813/?ref_=tt_urv","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.
MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.
I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.
Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.
What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.
THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.

"","","A tale of personal business","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1578477/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.","","","","9"

"","","Overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2680715/?ref_=tt_urv","If you aren't a thug lover... if you don't drool over less than smart bad guys somehow getting ahead... if you don't really like spectacle just for spectacle sake... then this movie may not be for you. To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.
Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.
So sorry, this movie just isn't great.

"","","Best gangsters movie ever.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3304930/?ref_=tt_urv","This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's ""five families"". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.
If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century. Those who love good cinema must see this film.","","","","10"
"","","Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123275/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.
The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.
Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.
I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center.
I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.
Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.
Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.
I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".
I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger.","","","","1"

"","","Just what everyone needs: another 10/10 review of The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5715397/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying.""
But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...
... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I ""had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled""... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.
We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.
Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).
Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).
If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.
Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime.","","","","10"

"","","Doors, windows, mirrors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1103148/?ref_=tt_urv","In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).
Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).
Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).
Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).
Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.","","","","8"

"","","A study in social pathology","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1214995/?ref_=tt_urv","A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star.","","","","10"
"","","Classic in Crime and Cinema in General","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8314864/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.
This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.
There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.
My Rating: 10 out of 10.","","","","10"
"","","Stylish classic a head of its time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8250734/?ref_=tt_urv","A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full.

"","","A Behemoth of Modern Cinema, Still Potent After Fifty Years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5780330/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.
It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.
Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.","","","","10"
"","","A truly story driven plot line","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1273831/?ref_=tt_urv","This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.
There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.","","","","9"
"","","Tedious beyond belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8018394/?ref_=tt_urv","I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it.

"","","a strange choice for best movie (but sure beats LOTR)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123791/?ref_=tt_urv","Hollywood has some strange politics. Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops. Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves. And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow). Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.
All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs. I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power. I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""
I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here. And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film). Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.
I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world). But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.","","","","7"
"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7147105/?ref_=tt_urv","This film is definitely an important step in the world of cinema, the acting is great, the plot is great, everything about it is great. I however do not consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time, a very enjoyable film no doubt but in my view not something I'd put in my top ten.

"","","A beautiful film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1871949/?ref_=tt_urv","I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse.

"","","Not just a guy film.... maybe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123626/?ref_=tt_urv","What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said? The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling. I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film.
The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it. However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C) It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater.
Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime. If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.

The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?

"","","One of the best films ever made -- beautiful & poetic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5527113/?ref_=tt_urv","This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.
The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.
The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.
The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.
What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.
5/5. Beautiful. A must watch.","","","","10"

"","","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4756923/?ref_=tt_urv","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.
The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.
Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","","","","10"
"","","For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059579/?ref_=tt_urv","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

"","","One of the best of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568526/?ref_=tt_urv","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","","","","10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

"","","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496808/?ref_=tt_urv","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.","","","","10"
"","","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2281063/?ref_=tt_urv","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.
The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.
The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.
In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","","","","10"

"","","Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6889513/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

"","","Everything you've ever heard is true...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990221/?ref_=tt_urv","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.
Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","","","","10"

"","","Amazing movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427701/?ref_=tt_urv","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","","","","10"
"","","The Don And His Sons","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836289/?ref_=tt_urv","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.
Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.
The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.
Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.
In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.
Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.
The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.
The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.
In fact it's all beautifully played.","","","","10"

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

"","","The world inside the underworld!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118627/?ref_=tt_urv","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.
I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

"","","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066533/?ref_=tt_urv","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.
The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.
Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.
But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.
To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.
But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.
Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).
Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.
If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film.","","","","10"

Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.","","","","10"
"","","Good but overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6306481/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.
For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.

Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

"","","The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207692/?ref_=tt_urv","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.","","","","10"
"","","Slightly overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123321/?ref_=tt_urv","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.
And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).
So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

"","","A genre-defining masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3375811/?ref_=tt_urv","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.
Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.
Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.
Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.
So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.
An all-time classic.","","","","10"

"","","Count Me In The Minority","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123507/?ref_=tt_urv","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.
I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.
The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""
It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"","","Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3426944/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).
In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way
The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.
Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.
Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.
Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).
In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.","","","","10"
"","","Not sure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8234013/?ref_=tt_urv","I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.
The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.
But i never get into it.
The plot is ok but i wanted more.
I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.
They just ""looked"" and there was silence.
I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".
I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.
The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.
Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.
For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.
I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.","","","","7"
"","","A masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796174/?ref_=tt_urv","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.
A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.
This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.","","","","10"

"","","Great But Overrated Movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2031194/?ref_=tt_urv","I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.
This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.
The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.
The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.
One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.
Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.","","","","8"
"","","What is there to say?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265304/?ref_=tt_urv","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.
There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.
Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.
Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.","","","","9"
"","","How things were done back then!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689458/?ref_=tt_urv","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

"","","Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320178/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.
The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.
The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.
Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.
As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.
Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.","","","","9"

There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.

Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.
I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.
The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.
The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.
The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.
A powerful and unforgettable film achievement.","","","","10"

"","","THE crime epic of the 20th century.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136217/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.
Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.
The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.
But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.
The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.
In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.
It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.
It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.
Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

"","","Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336914/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!
The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.
Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.
Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

"","","A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1953287/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.
The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.
The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

"","","Oh, Those Corleones....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070011/?ref_=tt_urv","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.
And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.
Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.
Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.
Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.
Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).
Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

"","","a classic when first released; only improves with age","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342530/?ref_=tt_urv","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.","","","","10"

"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5188668/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.
When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.
Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.
The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.
Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.
The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.
In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.
The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.
So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.
Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.","","","","10"
"","","No Movie is the Best Movie Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827013/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.
The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.","","","","10"

"","","The Greatest, no questions asked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1134243/?ref_=tt_urv","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.
Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.
The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.
Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.
I highly recommend this movie.","","","","10"
"","","""He is a good godson.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2729958/?ref_=tt_urv","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.
On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.
The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.
As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.
Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

"","","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234196/?ref_=tt_urv","Greetings from Lithuania.
To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.
There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.
Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.
Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.","","","","10"

"","","""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834930/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.
Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.
The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film
This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.
The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.
The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.
Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.
Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.
My Grade: A-","","","","9"
"","","A view from the other side of life.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159156/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.
The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.
The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.
The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.","","","","10"

"","","""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163208/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.
Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.
What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.
The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.
Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.
Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.
Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

"","","A work of art.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123660/?ref_=tt_urv","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.
Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.
To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.","","","","10"

And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"","","The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486729/?ref_=tt_urv","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.
Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.
This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.
The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.
A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.","","","","9"
"","","The best movie by far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202406/?ref_=tt_urv","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...
The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.
What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.","","","","10"

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.
The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!
The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.
I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.
There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.
Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.
It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.
Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.
The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.","","","","10"

"","","I Know I'm In The Minority.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172619/?ref_=tt_urv","I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.
I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.
With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.
Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated","","","","8"

Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period.

"","","""I believe in America""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033399/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.
A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.
Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.","","","","10"

"","","Has its moments, but not the best film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227961/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

"","","This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1955612/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.
Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.
Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.
The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.
Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.
Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.
His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.
An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.","","","","10"
"","","In the dictionary under masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655957/?ref_=tt_urv","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.
I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.
This is an epic in every sense of the word.

"","","an obvious word: masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123020/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.
Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.","","","","10"

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same
Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!
What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!
So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!","","","","10"

"","","with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2065184/?ref_=tt_urv","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.
Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.
""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.
Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.
Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.
But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.
""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.","","","","10"

'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10","","","","9"
"","","Timeless Mafia Film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2860842/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.
Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.
A masterpiece.

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly.

Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

"","","VERY good, but not the best...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123623/?ref_=tt_urv","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.
The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.
""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.
So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

"","","Best film ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283184/?ref_=tt_urv","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.
This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10","","","","10"
"","","Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1288467/?ref_=tt_urv","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.
Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.
Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.
The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.
It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.","","","","7"
"","","One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2989297/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.
Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.
What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.
The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.
The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.
The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.
In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","","","","10"
"","","ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4370695/?ref_=tt_urv","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠
'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.
Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.
The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.
'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.
Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.","","","","10"
"","","One of the greats, if not the great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367980/?ref_=tt_urv","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.
The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.
With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.","","","","10"

"","","Truly masterly film-making, right up there with Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1079358/?ref_=tt_urv","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs
The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.
It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.
Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)
What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****","","","","10"
"","","This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6249280/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.
Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Number 1 - 1972
Number 1 - 1970s
Top 5 - All Time
An offer you can't refuse ...
The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever
Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.
Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.
Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:
'The best gangster film since The Godfather'
Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.
Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

"","","A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123093/?ref_=tt_urv","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.
For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.
This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.
My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.","","","","9"

This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.

"","","A novel of images","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190343/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.
""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).
""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.
""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.
""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...
A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.","","","","9"

"","","America's Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425741/?ref_=tt_urv","Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.
It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.
This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.
But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.
The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.
There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.
""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.
One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.
The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.
Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.
In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.
Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.
Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.","","","","10"

"","","Showy and shallow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164485/?ref_=tt_urv","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.","","","","6"
"","","Almost Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224527/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.

"","","Let's Get Down To The Facts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158700/?ref_=tt_urv","OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.

This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).
With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.
It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.
All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.","","","","10"
"","","The Godfather is so good that real life gangsters patterned themselves after the movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123168/?ref_=tt_urv","It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen.

"","","Marlon Brando at his best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347112/?ref_=tt_urv","Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.
But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.
But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.","","","","10"

Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.

"","","The definitive mob movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3225734/?ref_=tt_urv","Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.","","","","10"
"","","Definitely not a masterpece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473289/?ref_=tt_urv","I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.

"","","Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6820406/?ref_=tt_urv","I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.
This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.

Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable.

"","","List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123426/?ref_=tt_urv","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.
You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.
I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.","","","","3"
"","","Its good but Geez....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123788/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.
I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.
Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.

"","","And so it begins","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2748198/?ref_=tt_urv","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.
Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.
The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)","","","","10"

"","","Not great, merely very well made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123618/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.

"","","Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1165554/?ref_=tt_urv","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.
All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.
And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.
The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.
The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.
Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.
Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.","","","","4"
"","","Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239324/?ref_=tt_urv","No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.
There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.

"","","Great film making in a moral vacuum.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123487/?ref_=tt_urv","A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.
The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.
Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.
I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.
Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.
Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.
Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.
We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.
The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.
(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)
Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""
Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".
The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.
Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...","","","","9"

First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting.

"","","Massively overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123460/?ref_=tt_urv","I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.
Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.

"","","Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1292892/?ref_=tt_urv","Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?
""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.
Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)
This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.
So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart.""","","","","1"
"","","Overrated, but still good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8655130/?ref_=tt_urv","I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.
The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.
The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.

"","","Never understood the hype","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8216203/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.

It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.
Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.
Hardly something worthy of praise.
The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.

"","","Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1440905/?ref_=tt_urv","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.
But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.
I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.
Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.
Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.
A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.","","","","7"

"","","Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123212/?ref_=tt_urv","Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.
However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able.
Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one.
The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.","","","","10"

"","","Excellent movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123407/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever. Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia. James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens. A big accident. Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director. He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here. the acting was wonderful from everybody. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome.
Overall this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I watch it all of the time. Rating 11 out of 10. (Tied for favorite movie)

"","","An Excellent Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5538326/?ref_=tt_urv","Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States ""Don Vito Corleone"" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ""Connie Corleone"" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort.","","","","10"
"","","Best Crime Movies Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4658041/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).
The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.
He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972.","","","","10"
"","","Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3810813/?ref_=tt_urv","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.
MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.
I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.
Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.
What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.
THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.

"","","A tale of personal business","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1578477/?ref_=tt_urv","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.","","","","9"

Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.
If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century.

"","","Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123275/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.
The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.
Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.
I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center.
I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.
Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.
Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.
I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".
I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger.","","","","1"

The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying.""
But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...
... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I ""had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled""... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.
We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.
Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).
Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).
If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.
Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime.","","","","10"

"","","Doors, windows, mirrors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1103148/?ref_=tt_urv","In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).
Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).
Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).
Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).
Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.","","","","8"

"","","A study in social pathology","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1214995/?ref_=tt_urv","A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star.","","","","10"
"","","Classic in Crime and Cinema in General","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8314864/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.
This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.
There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.
My Rating: 10 out of 10.","","","","10"
"","","Stylish classic a head of its time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8250734/?ref_=tt_urv","A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full.

"","","A Behemoth of Modern Cinema, Still Potent After Fifty Years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5780330/?ref_=tt_urv","The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.
It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.
Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.","","","","10"
"","","A truly story driven plot line","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1273831/?ref_=tt_urv","This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.
There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.","","","","9"
"","","Tedious beyond belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8018394/?ref_=tt_urv","I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it.

"","","a strange choice for best movie (but sure beats LOTR)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123791/?ref_=tt_urv","Hollywood has some strange politics. Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops. Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves. And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow). Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.
All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs. I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power. I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""
I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here. And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film). Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.
I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world). But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.","","","","7"
"","","The Godfather","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7147105/?ref_=tt_urv","This film is definitely an important step in the world of cinema, the acting is great, the plot is great, everything about it is great. I however do not consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time, a very enjoyable film no doubt but in my view not something I'd put in my top ten.

"","","A beautiful film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1871949/?ref_=tt_urv","I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse.

"","","Not just a guy film.... maybe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0123626/?ref_=tt_urv","What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said? The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling. I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film.
The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it. However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C) It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater.
Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime. If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.

It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10.

The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?

"","","One of the best films ever made -- beautiful & poetic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5527113/?ref_=tt_urv","This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.
The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.
The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.
The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.
What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.

It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best.

It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. ""The Godfather"" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately ""The Godfather"" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen

"","","What is so great about it?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1456986/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time.""

"","","""The Offer"" TV series compelled me to finally watch ""The Godfather""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8946361/?ref_=tt_urv","Now I love movies in general, but somehow the so-called masterpiece ""The Godfather"" from 1972 has not appealed to me enough to sit through the darkly-lit, three-hour running time. However, I hear great things about ""The Offer"" which is about the making of ""The Godfather,"" so I decide to invest ten minutes of my time to see what this series is about. It is indeed a well-made show, with a good story, and I end up watching all episodes. So now in 2023 I just have to watch ""The Godfather."" I can see why this movie would be considered a classic for its time. It has interesting, brooding shots, cast with powerhouse actors, some not yet famous at the time but have since become huge celebrities in their own right. I do have issues with the movie's slow pace, some campy acting from supporting actors, like a couple of mafia sidekicks and the father of the bride in Sicily, awkward fade transitions between scenes, and some rather disjointed turn of events. But all of that is forgiven now that I have discovered the gem that is Al Pacino. I have watched a few of his later movies when he is already considered a legendary actor, but nothing has tickled my fancy until seeing him as a young, very handsome Pacino in ""The Godfather,"" who can convey a million emotions just from his piercing thoughtful gaze. ""The Offer"" is correct; you cannot take your eyes off Pacino as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather,"" even as you witness his gradual moral deterioration. For this, I give this ""classic"" 8 stars in 2023.","","","","8"

"","","Would you like an orange?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2575108/?ref_=tt_urv","Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. ""I believe in America."" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.
It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.
There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!
At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.
Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc.
There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!
It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an ""eye-level"" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.
The famous ""Mattress Sequence"" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.
It's quite fascinating to recognize how many ""classic"" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.
One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.
The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.
So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).
Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse.","","","","10"

""The Godfather"" is simply TOO perfect. The acting. The dialogue, the action, the overall story. People expecting video game action, pleas look elsewhere or go to bed. ""The Godfather"" is simply one of cinema's greatest achievements!

"","","Cinema, what has become epochal","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8343383/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Godfather"" - 3 Oscars, including for the Best film, the cast, which became legendary, the images imitated by followers. This film marked an entire era of gangster cinema fashion.
Francis Ford Coppola's film lasts almost 3 hours. Yes, it is long, in places it seems that it is drawn out, but this is due to the fact that the film was released more than 45 years ago. Then it was not fashionable and necessary to show constant action on the screen, the scenes were long. However, this, in my opinion, helped to show the life of the main characters more detailed, to feel their characters, to better understand their motivation.
There are two key figures in the film. And they are played by iconic actors. Marlon Brando masterfully tries on the mantle of the main mafia, who enjoys indisputable authority. This is felt in every frame, in every scene where there is a hero Don Vito Corleone. He solves issues, gives advice, is responsible for the whole family. Brando manages this image very well, you believe him, you associate him with Don Corleone for a long time.
Al Pacino plays Brando's son named Michael. And from the very first frames you realize that he chose a different fate. He's going the other way. A valiant soldier, a loyal son whose fate turns out to be different than he planned. And the character changes throughout the film. Coppola demonstrates this perfectly, and Pacino helps him by revealing himself in every scene. This is a wonderful work of an actor who got used to the role.
The rest of the cast is decent, but they all take their place in the picture, allowing Brando and Pacino to be the center of attention.
The painting perfectly conveys the spirit of the time. Gang wars, underground business, family troubles, death. All this is closely intertwined with the plot, perfectly placed in the frame, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere of an action movie.
I like the picture. There are no beautifully staged shootouts, fights, which is typical for today's Hollywood. This movie is a classic. The colors are faded, the deaths of people look much more realistic. It's as if you understand that this is not a movie, but the decisive truth, if you find yourself in that terrible world. After all, the mafia and its wars are not the beauty that you expect to see, even if it is gangster. This is a horror that you should not get into, because the result is likely to be death: yours and your loved ones. Is it necessary?
The soundtrack is also beautiful. The main musical theme is recognized always and everywhere and does not age even after almost 50 years. This is the test of time.
Coppola's film is ultimatum, beautiful and cruel at the same time, it shows the world of gangsters without embellishment, makes you think about the terrible times of gang wars. But he also makes it clear that the family is a very important place, so to speak. A family is a home, it is a motivator, it is a fortress in which there are necessarily difficult milestones.
Coppola's work is an excellent film adaptation of Puzo's book, which is a must-see for everyone in due time. Classics are immortal.

"","","Classic movie you can't miss!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4213858/?ref_=tt_urv","When people are asked what the greatest movie ever made is, many people say Citizen Kane(I being one) but others will say The Godfather. I would not rank it that high, but I do think it is great. (I think the 2nd film is better, actually). It runs long at nearly 3 hours but it is very worth it! It's just such an iconic look at the Mafia. If you have never seen The Godfather and are offered a chance, take it. It's an offer you can't refuse.

"","","A timeless classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3734396/?ref_=tt_urv","The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.

"","","Good film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8354390/?ref_=tt_urv","Although I think that this movie is slightly overrated (forgive me for saying that). I did love this movie though! It had a good plot and the acting was great. The length of this movie didn't bother me, if anything I think it added to it. I don't think this movie deserves to be in the top two, definitely in the top 10 though.

"","","Arguably, the greatest film of all time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1907212/?ref_=tt_urv","The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.
I give The Godfather a perfect:
5/5 or 10/10

"","","The best Movie ever made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3462429/?ref_=tt_urv","If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death! I cannot understand people who do not like this movie!
It is suspenseful, partly shocking, political, love story and much more... Simply the best movie of all time
If there is someone who reads this review and hasn't watched The Godfather... WATCH THIS ONE and you will agree that there is no movie that is better! Believe me! Watch The Godfather!
NOW!!!

"","","Classic. Timeless. Masterpiece. Perfect. Best film maybe ever...Must I continue?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1897730/?ref_=tt_urv","If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch ""The Godfather,"" then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name ""Francis Ford Coppola,"" the cast list including Marlon Brando, the ""won Oscar for best picture"" and the phrase ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" mean absolutely nothing to you.
This is the greatest crime drama if not the greatest drama if not the greatest film of all time, so yes, it is worth your time. Then you need to watch ""The Godfather: Part II.""
This is a deep, enriching and beautiful film in every sense of those words and will forever echo through cinematic history.
Looking for any other sweeping statements? I could go on and on. You can't say anything bad about this film. You could say 175 minutes is too long, but if that's what it takes for a masterpiece, so be it.
If it's not every bit of what I said it is, the canolli's on me.","","","","10"
