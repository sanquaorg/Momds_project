He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it.

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.
A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","suryanmukul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur121145920/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","So well written that makes you questioning the reality. ⭐","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8902108/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.
And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.
It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"
"","","...it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3283017/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.
I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?
This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.","lastliberal-853-253708","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23944958/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2015","9"
"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","Benchmark forever.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6139973/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix - 1999
This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.
A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","suryanmukul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur121145920/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion.

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.

We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.
And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.
It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years.

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.
I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.","emptyskies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1714901/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2002","10"

If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.

We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.

The Matrix has some of the best practical effects that I have ever seen. The CGI tech was jarring whenever it was used, but thankfully it wasn't relied on heavily. The score was fantastic, the plot intriguing, and the story enthralling.

You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.
This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?
The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?
Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches.

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?
This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.","lastliberal-853-253708","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23944958/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2015","9"
"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons.

The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. The action sequences use way better CGI than any recent movies we saw in 2020 or any other recent movies. It's full action packed and the effects they used is way ahead of their time.

"","","Let's ponder on the influence of ""The Matrix"" to the whole industry...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4429362/?ref_=tt_urv","It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.
I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.
Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

"","","""Ignorance is Bliss""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2703697/?ref_=tt_urv","Ultra-stylish Techno-Noir classic that is broad on concept and design and creates a novel realm of realism vs cerebral creation. This is groundbreaking visual stuff and is backed by extraordinary electronic/metal music and really cool sets.
It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.
It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"
"","","The single BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2410919/?ref_=tt_urv","How could anyone claim that for any movie ? How pretentious am I to impose this premise ? Everybody's different, so no one movie could ever be the goat...
uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:
Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.
Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.
Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.
Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:
Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...
Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.
Not to even mention this movie created an entire sub-culture, cult following; ""what is the Matrix ?"".","Horror-yo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12771356/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2011","10"

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

"","","Absurd from beginning to end","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511457/?ref_=tt_urv","'Frank? Larry here. How are you? Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.
Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects
Cons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the film

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2093818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2009","10"

When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""

My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI.

Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist.

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons.

We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.

"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).

The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.","SnoopyStyle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2013","9"
"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.
I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.","MrsRainbow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0215141/?ref_=tt_urv","2 April 1999",""

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.
Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects
Cons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the film

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2093818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2009","10"

"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

"","","Good but not ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509921/?ref_=tt_urv","Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""
That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"
"","","Too many cultural references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6337836/?ref_=tt_urv","I was completely disappointed by this movie.
I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.
All I though was, 'Huh.' Still a good movie though.","taldarus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126920707/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2020","7"
"","","Are you the one ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4956384/?ref_=tt_urv","If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"

The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.
The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go.

With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.
A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","suryanmukul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur121145920/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.

I enjoyed watching the movie when I was 9 but it's really cool
I love this movie because it's got Cyberpunk style, kung-fu fight scenes and Shooting Sprees. My Favourite Character is Neo because he's really cool.
This is one of my Favourite movies of all time
I give it 10/10

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.

"","","A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509368/?ref_=tt_urv","Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.
Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!
10/10

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

I knew it was genre redefining for the time, but I assumed that it would not age well given how tech dependant it should have been. I could not have been more wrong.
The Matrix has some of the best practical effects that I have ever seen. The CGI tech was jarring whenever it was used, but thankfully it wasn't relied on heavily. The score was fantastic, the plot intriguing, and the story enthralling.

"","","Guns. Leather. Keanu Reeves. How cool can it get?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509495/?ref_=tt_urv","You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.
This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?
The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?
Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.
You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.
It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:
Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.
Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.
Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.
Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:
Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...
Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.
Not to even mention this movie created an entire sub-culture, cult following; ""what is the Matrix ?"".","Horror-yo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12771356/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2011","10"

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.","CuriosityKilledShawn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0102816/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2004","6"

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.
Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to.

"","","Superb and revolutionary film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7663003/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a superb and revolutionary film that combines multiple genres and ideas to create something unique. A thought provoking, action packed and inventive film that's impressive visual effects still almost entirely hold up.
Keanu Reeves gives a perfect lead performance that always anchors the film and keeps it grounded and focused. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are both incredible with effortlessly cool and stylish supporting performances. Hugo Weaving is a phenomenal villain who is effectively cold and calculating yet also full of rage.
The Wachowski's direction is excellent, with director of photography Bill Pope they manage to create clean and comprehensible action scenes as well as some truly mind blowing moments. The music by Don Davis is great, suitably epic and high tech with a solid soundtrack that suits the film's tone.","masonsaul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2021","10"
"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.
The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!","SoumikBanerjee1996","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46919419/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2022","9"

"","","Good but not ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509921/?ref_=tt_urv","Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""
That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 1999",""

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"
"","","Too many cultural references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6337836/?ref_=tt_urv","I was completely disappointed by this movie.
I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.

Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

I can recite it word for word but I couldn't tell what the words imply about the movie itself. So to rewatch it all these years later and say it holds up pretty well is very satisfying. The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"
"","","Groundbreaking thought-provoking film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657325/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is groundbreaking and the start of the modern-day effects we see today. From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.
The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.
With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.
The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.
The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed.","akdjreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129603614/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","10"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!
The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

The Wachowski Brothers, who showed so much promise with ""Bound,"" their first feature, not only wrote the terrible script but also dreamed up the lame special effects. This is an utter waste of time.","kenjha","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2590596/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2008","1"
"","","Reeves Seriously Miscast As ""Neo""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3235359/?ref_=tt_urv","You know, each time I view The Matrix, once again, I find that I'm liking the thing less and less. It's true. In fact, it's actually gotten to the point here where I literally find myself about a hair's breadth away from totally hating this flick, big time. Yep. I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.
It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.
It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do. I really think that he makes a damn-lousy Neo. I mean - Let's face it - Reeves just isn't a very convincing bright-boy. And he makes a truly terrible lover for Trinity, too.

"","","One of the Greatest Flukes of All Time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510077/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" is easily one of the most, if not the most, over-rated film ever made. It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead. They are just as empty and meaningless as ""The Matrix"". 2.5 out of 5 stars.","tfrizzell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0688559/?ref_=tt_urv","15 March 2002",""
"","","Laughably Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509785/?ref_=tt_urv","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.
The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

I had to have my friends explain it to me, of course, but once they did I thought it was one of the coolest premises ever conceived. ""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since. And it's also in the same league as films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" that redefined what movie special effects could do.

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago.

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?
This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.","lastliberal-853-253708","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23944958/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2015","9"
"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons.

The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.

""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.","SnoopyStyle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2013","9"
"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.
I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.","MrsRainbow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0215141/?ref_=tt_urv","2 April 1999",""

"","","The Matrix has Buddhist themes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1100760/?ref_=tt_urv","A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...
When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.","CuriosityKilledShawn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0102816/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2004","6"

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.
Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers.","ccthemovieman-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4445210/?ref_=tt_urv","18 October 2006","8"
"","","Absurd from beginning to end","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511457/?ref_=tt_urv","'Frank? Larry here. How are you? Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.
Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects
Cons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the film

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2093818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2009","10"

"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""

My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"
"","","Keanu Reeves in Wonderland","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1999621/?ref_=tt_urv","Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.
""Unfortunately, nobody can be told what 'The Matrix' is. You have to see it for yourself.""
I watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next...
A stunning audio-visual achievement.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"
"","","Too many cultural references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6337836/?ref_=tt_urv","I was completely disappointed by this movie.
I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.
All I though was, 'Huh.' Still a good movie though.","taldarus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126920707/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2020","7"
"","","Are you the one ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4956384/?ref_=tt_urv","If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"

The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!

How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

"","","Unforgettable and iconic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7698039/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It draws heavily from sci-fi classics such as Ghost in the Shell and Neuromancer, exploring themes of systemic societal exploitation, the notion and expression of the self, as well as technology encroaching onto the human body and mind and the dread of a now all-too-known dystopic future, all of it wrapped up in a shell of sleek, leather and vinyl-clad punk visuals and beautifully choreographed fights.
Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.
It's one of those movies that can give you chills and enthrall you with its scenes, even after all these years. Truly, it's an incredible experience.","joao-luiz_mjr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56874759/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2021","10"
"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

"","","Unbearable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3108662/?ref_=tt_urv","This is unbearable nonsense combined with irritating action scenes. The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.
But let's get to the political message. No, I'm kidding. I'm not going there. But if you haven't understood it, what's the point of me telling you anything?
I will say though, that I do not wish to be a part of the kind of humanity the film depicts, even if we never get to fight evil machines. There are worse things than machines in this world.","harryplinkett14","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7242773/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2014","1"

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved.

Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.
Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"". So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character. (nevermind that the mystic nonsense is somewhat demystified in the sequel films; this review is about *this* film).

Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else.

"","","Laughably Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509785/?ref_=tt_urv","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.
The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since.

"","","It's been done better before","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508769/?ref_=tt_urv","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).
The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).
Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.
Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.
Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

"","","Pretentious and tiresome film features superb sfx","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510350/?ref_=tt_urv","It is really a shame that the talented Wachowski brothers did not spend more time paring down the sprawling, unwieldy, and ultimately confusing and unsatisfying plot threads of The Matrix and settle in on one. Had they found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects would have seemed even more special. A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc. Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.","pooch-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0197287/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 1999",""
"","","Still the one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623958/?ref_=tt_urv","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!
Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.
I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.
Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.
It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.
Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.","southdavid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2021","9"

"","","A lot of style, but that was good.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5415497/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is one of those classics that even those who have never seen know to hear about. And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.
I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".
Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.
The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.
Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2020","9"

"","","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511460/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.
For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?
The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).
Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.
I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.
I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.
As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","dr_foreman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1052098/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2004","4"

I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise
To sum up this is a good film .

--
I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.
The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.
As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.
But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.
Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).
Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).
But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.
""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.
""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","So well written that makes you questioning the reality. ⭐","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8902108/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.
And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.
It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""
Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.
And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more.","EVON1TY","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47939660/?ref_=tt_urv","2 March 2023","10"
"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?
This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.","lastliberal-853-253708","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23944958/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2015","9"
"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"
"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years.

It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons.

The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.
Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.

""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"

When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.
Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.
Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.
Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:
Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...
Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""

The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.

Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.

An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to.

When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 1999",""

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.
""Unfortunately, nobody can be told what 'The Matrix' is. You have to see it for yourself.""

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"
"","","Too many cultural references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6337836/?ref_=tt_urv","I was completely disappointed by this movie.
I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.
All I though was, 'Huh.' Still a good movie though.","taldarus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126920707/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2020","7"
"","","Are you the one ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4956384/?ref_=tt_urv","If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!
The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.
This .movie is so good. If you haven't watched it for a while or again as an adult, I'd highly recommend.","hooma814","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur113789660/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2020","9"

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

"","","Unforgettable and iconic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7698039/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It draws heavily from sci-fi classics such as Ghost in the Shell and Neuromancer, exploring themes of systemic societal exploitation, the notion and expression of the self, as well as technology encroaching onto the human body and mind and the dread of a now all-too-known dystopic future, all of it wrapped up in a shell of sleek, leather and vinyl-clad punk visuals and beautifully choreographed fights.
Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

Over twenty years old, and it still packs a huge punch, The Matrix will forever be a sci fi masterpiece. It is lightening paced, energy charged, and filled with tonnes of original ideas.
Epic action sequences galore, but it is so much more than just an action movie, it covers so many genres, and as such will have a very broad appeal, horror sci fi lovers in particular will find it so rewarding.
The special effects hold up incredibly well, and I still find the scene where Neo wakes up incredibly chilling, Reeves looks so different, you'll question whether it really is him or not.
It was obvious that sequels were going to follow, but of course none of them have quite been able to recapture the sheer magic of the original.

The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.
But let's get to the political message. No, I'm kidding. I'm not going there. But if you haven't understood it, what's the point of me telling you anything?
I will say though, that I do not wish to be a part of the kind of humanity the film depicts, even if we never get to fight evil machines. There are worse things than machines in this world.","harryplinkett14","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7242773/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2014","1"

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved.

All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even worse.

Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.
Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"". So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character.

The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon.

The reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the ""Alien"" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing.","led_zeppelin_zoso","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4886635/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2005","8"

"","","It's been done better before","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508769/?ref_=tt_urv","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).
The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).
Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.
Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.
Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

Had they found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects would have seemed even more special. A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc. Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.","pooch-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0197287/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 1999",""
"","","Still the one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623958/?ref_=tt_urv","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!
Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.
I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.
Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.
It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.
Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.","southdavid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2021","9"

"","","A lot of style, but that was good.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5415497/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie is one of those classics that even those who have never seen know to hear about. And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.
I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".
Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.
The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.
Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2020","9"

"","","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511460/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.
For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?
The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).
Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.
I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.
I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.
As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","dr_foreman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1052098/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2004","4"

It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again .

I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise
To sum up this is a good film .

--
I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.
The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.
As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.
But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.
Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).
Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).
But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.
""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.
""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.
Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.

I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.
As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.
In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.
I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.
So,overall,I'd say The Matrix was an intelligent,original Sci-Fi movie which was a bit too long and did'nt really handle it's source material to well.So,go figure.***","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 1999",""

It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.
Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.
Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.
The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.
We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.
I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.","braddugg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17029428/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2014","6"

"","","Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7707902/?ref_=tt_urv","The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.
The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.
But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.
Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.","Mike_Devine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2021","8"

"","","The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1076864/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.
For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.
""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.
The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.","The_Other_Snowman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4963708/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2005","2"

"","","The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7234460/?ref_=tt_urv","So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.
Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.
Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.
So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.
Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.
Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.
In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.
And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?
It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.
So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.","TheCorniestLemur","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96762914/?ref_=tt_urv","16 August 2021","9"
"","","Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7641718/?ref_=tt_urv","Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.
I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.
I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.
So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.
With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.
And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.
It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.
And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.
He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.
It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.","IQ42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76439477/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2021","5"
"","","Tedium Beyond Belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509902/?ref_=tt_urv","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.
The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.
The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.
For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.
People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.
Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!
This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.
BAD!

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.
A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","suryanmukul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur121145920/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.

"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.

I enjoyed watching the movie when I was 9 but it's really cool
I love this movie because it's got Cyberpunk style, kung-fu fight scenes and Shooting Sprees. My Favourite Character is Neo because he's really cool.
This is one of my Favourite movies of all time

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.

We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all.

You take your seat and watch the trailers.

This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?
The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?
Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.
It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.
Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.
Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.
Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:
Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...
Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""

The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.

Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2093818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2009","10"
"","","Superb and revolutionary film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7663003/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a superb and revolutionary film that combines multiple genres and ideas to create something unique. A thought provoking, action packed and inventive film that's impressive visual effects still almost entirely hold up.
Keanu Reeves gives a perfect lead performance that always anchors the film and keeps it grounded and focused. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are both incredible with effortlessly cool and stylish supporting performances. Hugo Weaving is a phenomenal villain who is effectively cold and calculating yet also full of rage.
The Wachowski's direction is excellent, with director of photography Bill Pope they manage to create clean and comprehensible action scenes as well as some truly mind blowing moments. The music by Don Davis is great, suitably epic and high tech with a solid soundtrack that suits the film's tone.","masonsaul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2021","10"
"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.
The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!","SoumikBanerjee1996","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46919419/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2022","9"

That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 1999",""

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"

I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.

Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

I can recite it word for word but I couldn't tell what the words imply about the movie itself. So to rewatch it all these years later and say it holds up pretty well is very satisfying. The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"
"","","Groundbreaking thought-provoking film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657325/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is groundbreaking and the start of the modern-day effects we see today. From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.
The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.
With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.
The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.
The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed.","akdjreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129603614/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","10"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!
The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.
It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.
It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do. I really think that he makes a damn-lousy Neo. I mean - Let's face it - Reeves just isn't a very convincing bright-boy. And he makes a truly terrible lover for Trinity, too.

It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead.

"","","Laughably Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509785/?ref_=tt_urv","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.
The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since.

"","","It's been done better before","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508769/?ref_=tt_urv","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).
The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).
Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.
Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.
Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc. Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.","pooch-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0197287/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 1999",""
"","","Still the one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623958/?ref_=tt_urv","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!
Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.
I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.
Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.
It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.
Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.","southdavid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2021","9"

And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.
I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".
Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.
The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.
Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny.

"","","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511460/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.
For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?
The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).
Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.
I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.
I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.
As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","dr_foreman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1052098/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2004","4"

It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise
To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film","Theo Robertson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177/?ref_=tt_urv","28 October 2003","7"

--
I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.
The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.
As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.
But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.
Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).
Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).
But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.
""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.
""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

It is assumed that there is a reason for this boy to be chosen and the search for that reason is the root of the plot. The rest is simply a visual delight that, like a porn, does not require a larger argument to support the viewer. The only people in love with the plot are those who love conspiracies and obviously they are not the majority.

I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020. The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe. Everything, every single thing about this movie was deep & convincing, there was just no flaw that could be said about it except the fight sequences, although they're not so bad to watch even after 2 decades, which is a fabulous achievement in itself.","saru2020","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66979966/?ref_=tt_urv","4 October 2020","10"

I understand the world created represents the ones and zeroes that surround the computer world and that the computer world has become a competitor with the real world. I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.
Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.

One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action. This is the highlight of the film, and without that, it would be almost like any other science-fiction/action movie.

I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.
As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.
In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.
I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.
So,overall,I'd say The Matrix was an intelligent,original Sci-Fi movie which was a bit too long and did'nt really handle it's source material to well.So,go figure.***","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 1999",""

He knew this film was beyond him and allowing the filmmakers to showcase the film and his character was the best choice. All actors excel at their roles.

It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.
Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.
Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.
The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.
We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.
I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.","braddugg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17029428/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2014","6"

"","","Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7707902/?ref_=tt_urv","The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.
The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.
But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.
Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.","Mike_Devine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2021","8"

"","","The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1076864/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.
For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.
""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.
The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.","The_Other_Snowman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4963708/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2005","2"

"","","The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7234460/?ref_=tt_urv","So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.
Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.
Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.
So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.
Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.
Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.
In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.
And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?
It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.
So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.","TheCorniestLemur","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96762914/?ref_=tt_urv","16 August 2021","9"
"","","Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7641718/?ref_=tt_urv","Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.
I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.
I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.
So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.
With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.
And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.
It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.
And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.
He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.
It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.","IQ42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76439477/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2021","5"
"","","Tedium Beyond Belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509902/?ref_=tt_urv","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.
The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.
The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.
For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.
People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.
Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!
This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.
BAD!

This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like this seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions and the concept, everything was awesome.
Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.
I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might seems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something like that was shown in movies.

'The Matrix' is one of my favorite films. I've seen it a dozen of times & when-ever I re-visit it, it only gets better. It's a solid entertainer, that is simply spell-binding.
Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski's Screenplay & Direction, both deserve top-honors. Their Screenplay is delicious, while, Their Direction is damn stylish. The entire execution to this box-office blockbuster deserves full marks. Action-Sequences are simply, amazing. Cinematography is flawless. Editing is neat. Art Design & Graphics are incredibly done.
Performance-Wise: Keanu Reeves as Neo, delivers one of his best performances in here. He's in top-form! Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, is fantastic! Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, is superlative. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, does well. Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, is impressive. Julian Arahanga as Apoc, is decent. Gloria Foster as the Oracle, leaves a mark.

"","","A Sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2976171/?ref_=tt_urv","Rating-9/10
The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.
The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.
I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.
The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.
The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.
People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.
I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.","willcundallreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47850240/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2014","9"

"","","More holes than a hunk o'swiss","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509647/?ref_=tt_urv","I didn't dislike this movie.
That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.
And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.
And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.
I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.","thebishop2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0858142/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2000","6"
"","","A revolutionary movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2722173/?ref_=tt_urv","When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".

"","","A Movie with Different Layers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1929505/?ref_=tt_urv","Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.
If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.
The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.
So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.","cyberknight","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0990598/?ref_=tt_urv","13 August 2008","10"

""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive"" This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis: Will you choose blue pills or red pills? Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought. On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream. But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever.

"","","You don't know Kung-Fu.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511463/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""
Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.
My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.
Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.

Because it is really cult one. I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.
For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.
Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.
And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting.

The premise of the film, that everything we see is a computer created illusion, called ""The Matrix,"" is sheer genius, and brings in elements of post deconstruction theory as well as Baudrillard.
And, Neo is One spelled sideways.

"","","The most overrated film ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509944/?ref_=tt_urv","Yeah, the effects were good. But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script. The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead. The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots. But the fact remains that this is a poor effort. There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting. The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts. The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.
If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor. You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards. The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?""

So, it's one of the best films ever.","chubarova","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106184494/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2021","10"

Is the plot solid? No. The background situation is so completely improbable that it borders on the ridiculous. The justification behind the action scenes is very, very weak. The potential philosophical content (about virtual realities) is completely ignored - unlike in Thirteenth Floor, for example. The symbolism is so heavy and cheap (Trinity, Neo = One, etc.) that it truly stinks.
And then you've got tons of ridiculous stuff going on. For example, within that virtual reality the heroes still have to use a heavy mobile phone to call home. And then they cannot be ""beamed"" from that cell phone, no, they have to go to a fixed line phone - how very likely and logical!

Another great scene is Neo and Trinity are in a white area room, he asks the Matrix for guns and you see infinite amount of guns appear. It's cool because anything you desire can appear to you in a snap.

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist.

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo.

"","","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509734/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.
All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","SdrolionGM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1084015/?ref_=tt_urv","3 March 2001",""
"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.
Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","mambubukid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0540275/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2000","10"

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons.

This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic.

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.

"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting. He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo. Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

"","","The Matrix has Buddhist themes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1100760/?ref_=tt_urv","A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...
When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!","elto-30283","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88491595/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2018","10"

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.
Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects
Cons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the film

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2093818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2009","10"

"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

"","","Good but not ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509921/?ref_=tt_urv","Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""
That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne.

"","","Too many cultural references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6337836/?ref_=tt_urv","I was completely disappointed by this movie.
I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.
All I though was, 'Huh.' Still a good movie though.","taldarus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126920707/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2020","7"
"","","Are you the one ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4956384/?ref_=tt_urv","If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"

From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.
The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.
With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.
The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.
The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed.","akdjreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129603614/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","10"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!
The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions.

"","","I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing original.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510056/?ref_=tt_urv","When I first saw the Matrix a few years ago, I thought it was a pretty good flick, but as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that the film ripped off from a variety of films such as the computer-animated masterpiece Tron and the intelligent action film Face/Off to name a few. Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved.

The only reason everybody dropped their jaws and praised this film was because of the great special effects and fight scenes. Believe me there is a lot more to a film than just it's special effects.

All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even worse.
If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick go out and get ""Planet of the Apes"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", or any one of the Star Wars films.

Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.
Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"".

Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else.

"","","Laughably Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509785/?ref_=tt_urv","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.
The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since.

"","","It's been done better before","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508769/?ref_=tt_urv","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).
The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).
Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.
Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.
Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

"","","Still the one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623958/?ref_=tt_urv","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!
Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.
I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.
Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.
It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.

And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.
I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".
Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.
The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.
Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny.

"","","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511460/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.
For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?
The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).
Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.
I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.
I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.
As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","dr_foreman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1052098/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2004","4"

I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise
To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film","Theo Robertson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177/?ref_=tt_urv","28 October 2003","7"

--
I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.
The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.
As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.
But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.
Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).
Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).
But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.
""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.
""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe. Everything, every single thing about this movie was deep & convincing, there was just no flaw that could be said about it except the fight sequences, although they're not so bad to watch even after 2 decades, which is a fabulous achievement in itself.","saru2020","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66979966/?ref_=tt_urv","4 October 2020","10"

I understand the world created represents the ones and zeroes that surround the computer world and that the computer world has become a competitor with the real world. I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.
Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.

I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.
As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.
In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.
I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.
So,overall,I'd say The Matrix was an intelligent,original Sci-Fi movie which was a bit too long and did'nt really handle it's source material to well.So,go figure.***","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 1999",""

It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.
Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.
Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.
The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.
We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.

"","","Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7707902/?ref_=tt_urv","The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.
The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.
But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.
Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.","Mike_Devine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2021","8"

To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.
For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.
""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.
The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie.

No, I just don't buy the ""great effects"" line. If I wanted to look at posters or posable figures, I'd do that. I prefer action scenes to have, well, action. Even the clumsy-chicks-on-wires-film (aka Charlie's Angels) has more involving action scenes than this confused rock video.
The acting is solid, but the less said about the plot, the better (no, it's not even remotely original). And at 136 minutes, this is a loooong grind. Raving fanboys, do me a favour and please describe a scene that's not in the first or last five minutes, and not on either side of one of the infrequent action scenes.

"","","The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7234460/?ref_=tt_urv","So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.
Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.
Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.
So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.
Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.
Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.
In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.
And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?
It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.
So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.","TheCorniestLemur","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96762914/?ref_=tt_urv","16 August 2021","9"
"","","Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7641718/?ref_=tt_urv","Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.
I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.
I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.
So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.
With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.
And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.
It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.
And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.
He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.
It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.","IQ42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76439477/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2021","5"
"","","Tedium Beyond Belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509902/?ref_=tt_urv","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.
The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.
The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.
For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.
People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.
Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!
This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.
BAD!

Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.
I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this.

The pc-multicult format which has been the bane of western film in the past twenty years is pretty prominent. Not as obnoxious as the rest that would follow but it's there.

"","","A Sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2976171/?ref_=tt_urv","Rating-9/10
The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.
The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.
I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.
The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.
The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.
People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.
I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.","willcundallreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47850240/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2014","9"

"","","More holes than a hunk o'swiss","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509647/?ref_=tt_urv","I didn't dislike this movie.
That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.
And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.
And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.
I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.","thebishop2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0858142/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2000","6"
"","","A revolutionary movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2722173/?ref_=tt_urv","When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".

"","","A Movie with Different Layers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1929505/?ref_=tt_urv","Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.
If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.
The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.
So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.","cyberknight","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0990598/?ref_=tt_urv","13 August 2008","10"

On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream. But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream.

"","","You don't know Kung-Fu.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511463/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""
Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.
My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.
Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.
It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell.","Manthorpe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2809796/?ref_=tt_urv","23 June 2004","6"

"","","Alternate reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5425753/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie introduced some real new ideas, solutions, and is probably most successful cult film. Because it is really cult one. I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.
For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.
Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.
And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting. Not good. Where is Neo, when we need him ?","pkpera","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3157590/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2020","8"

Preface; you must read the philosophical article ""Brain in a Vat,"" I believe by Hilary Putnam.
The premise of the film, that everything we see is a computer created illusion, called ""The Matrix,"" is sheer genius, and brings in elements of post deconstruction theory as well as Baudrillard.
And, Neo is One spelled sideways.
Incredible Christological symbology here, as well as Christian metaphors-his girlfriend is even named ""Trinity"" - the Father is Morpheus, the son is Neo - the ""One"" - Trinity is the Mary Magdalene figure- and the Holy Spirit, well, you figure it out.
Amazing action sequences and cinematography advanced for its time.

"","","The most overrated film ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509944/?ref_=tt_urv","Yeah, the effects were good. But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script. The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead. The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots. But the fact remains that this is a poor effort. There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting. The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts. The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.
If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor. You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards. The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?""

The potential philosophical content (about virtual realities) is completely ignored - unlike in Thirteenth Floor, for example. The symbolism is so heavy and cheap (Trinity, Neo = One, etc.) that it truly stinks.
And then you've got tons of ridiculous stuff going on. For example, within that virtual reality the heroes still have to use a heavy mobile phone to call home. And then they cannot be ""beamed"" from that cell phone, no, they have to go to a fixed line phone - how very likely and logical!

The world is your playground and anything becomes possible. That is so cool to hear! The computer animation is awesome. Super slow motion bullets, dodging moves, and the action scenes.
Another great scene is Neo and Trinity are in a white area room, he asks the Matrix for guns and you see infinite amount of guns appear. It's cool because anything you desire can appear to you in a snap.

"","","More fun than summer vacation.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509784/?ref_=tt_urv","I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.
Granted, it is a great story. Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great. But oh what a concept. Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures. But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.
The fight scenes are spectacular. Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it. Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side. And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.
Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted. His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving. I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.
My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy. ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills. I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak. I think that story line could have used a little work. Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.
All in all, you absolutely must own this movie. It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation.","budmassey","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0813657/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2001","9"

I thought the whole premise of our entire existence being fake was a good one. But, once seeing the movie, I realized that the premise isn't really expanded that much. It's just developed enough to hold together the action scenes. Maybe I would have been more entranced with a better cast.

"","","Ignore the sequels, this is The One","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1693090/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" is the driving force behind a string of half-arsed sci-fi/fantasy films (including 2 bloated and inferior Matrix sequels) that have appeared (and sunk without trace) in its wake since 1999. This film had a similar cultural impact to the original ""Star Wars"" and its high rating is well deserved. Often imitated but seldom equaled, ""The Matrix"" set so many new standards that it became sci-fi's yardstick for the new millennium.
It has that potent blend of action, adventure, philosophy and sex appeal that distinguishes a classic blockbuster movie from all the summer season also-rans. Name me one other big-hitting action movie from 1999. You're struggling, aren't you?
Of course you are. ""The Matrix"" was one of the first films to use ""Bullet Time"" camera effects in its gravity-defying slow-motion stunts. The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes. The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the figure-hugging shiny black PVC?
""The Matrix"" is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the formulaic sequels haven't dimmed the appeal of the original film.","extravaluejotter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8345459/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2007","7"
"","","Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509838/?ref_=tt_urv","People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again.
It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.
There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story.

Nevertheless, I have always liked good action, even if it happens in outer space. I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi. My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane.

"","","I know this will be unpopular","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511412/?ref_=tt_urv","OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.
First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequels
However, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.
Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.
Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.
If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.
A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","suryanmukul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur121145920/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

"","","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229286/?ref_=tt_urv","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.
Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.
Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.
The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.
To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film making for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora of both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your fingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking yourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, ""Wait, how did I get here and why am I here?""
MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's assertion ""The Medium is the Message"" has proved to be! Does Matrix glorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous? Most of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the point entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not substance.
Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360º sequential surround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic experience, on their own terms.
Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more convincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a newly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any negative preconceived notions and just listen....

"","","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642963/?ref_=tt_urv","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.
It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.
Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.
Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.
Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.
Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.
Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","9"
"","","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4679368/?ref_=tt_urv","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...
1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.
2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.
3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.
4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.
5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.
6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.
7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.
8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.
9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2019","10"

We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

"","","One of my favorites","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509222/?ref_=tt_urv","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.
I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.
The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.
My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","Xophianic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0097753/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2000","9"
"","","Welcome to the Real World.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4125407/?ref_=tt_urv","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.
The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.
The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.
In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","notoriousCASK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31221670/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2018","10"
"","","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6138670/?ref_=tt_urv","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.
I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.
Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.
The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","TaylorYee94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102296684/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2020","10"

Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).
But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.

"","","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509571/?ref_=tt_urv","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.
But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.
People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.

I enjoyed watching the movie when I was 9 but it's really cool
I love this movie because it's got Cyberpunk style, kung-fu fight scenes and Shooting Sprees. My Favourite Character is Neo because he's really cool.
This is one of my Favourite movies of all time

"","","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5071966/?ref_=tt_urv","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","Hitchcoc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0278527/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2019","9"
"","","Matrix - one of the greatest ever - in same league as The Shawshank Redemption & Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6185367/?ref_=tt_urv","What to say about the Matrix which has not already been said ? Sheer brilliance in every department. Those seeing faults in CGI can they come to terms with the fact this Universe looks exactly like it's meant to be real or unreal ? Why correlate with our Universe & how we see it ? 😊 Also, as for finding faults - well it's your limited understanding that you can't see the sheer beauty of Matrix Universe, concept of Maya, free will & choice.

"","","The more you watch it, the better it gets","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510123/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!
It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.
Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.
I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.","emptyskies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1714901/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2002","10"
"","","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4754914/?ref_=tt_urv","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!
For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.
The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!
A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!","UniqueParticle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34836174/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2019","10"
"","","A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509368/?ref_=tt_urv","Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.
The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.
With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)","MercurioKnight","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0700873/?ref_=tt_urv","27 April 2000",""

"","","Once in a lifetime film experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7659112/?ref_=tt_urv","Never will there be a film that can harness the creative worldbuilding, mind blowing story, and intricate themes of social commentary as well as The Matrix can. I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. The action sequences use way better CGI than any recent movies we saw in 2020 or any other recent movies.

"","","Let's ponder on the influence of ""The Matrix"" to the whole industry...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4429362/?ref_=tt_urv","It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.
I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.
Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.

"","","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045008/?ref_=tt_urv","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.
People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.
As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.
Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","zfiany","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19935607/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2009","10"
"","","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325661/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.
This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.
Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.
The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.
But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.
The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!
10/10

"","","Whoa!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2157668/?ref_=tt_urv","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.
What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.
It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).
In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

"","","Ultra cool sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901955/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.
The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.
But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible.

"","","at last, something I can recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509271/?ref_=tt_urv","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.
The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.
The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).
Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")
Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","johnfos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5306440/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2005","9"

"","","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174050/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.
The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.
Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""
The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.
Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.
A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""
The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.
Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

I knew it was genre redefining for the time, but I assumed that it would not age well given how tech dependant it should have been. I could not have been more wrong.
The Matrix has some of the best practical effects that I have ever seen. The CGI tech was jarring whenever it was used, but thankfully it wasn't relied on heavily.

"","","Guns. Leather. Keanu Reeves. How cool can it get?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509495/?ref_=tt_urv","You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.
This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?
The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?
Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.
You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'

"","","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1579162/?ref_=tt_urv","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.
""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.
Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2007","9"
"","","Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509958/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.
But...is that all it is?
No. It isn't.
When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.
Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.
Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""
Okay, stop yawning.
Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.
Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.
WHEW!!
That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.
And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","Skeletors_Hood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1358709/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2001","10"

It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.
It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.
The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.","LeonLouisRicci","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33374263/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2012","10"

uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:
Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.
Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.
Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.
Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:
Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...
Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.
Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.

"","","There's something very familiar about all this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511452/?ref_=tt_urv","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.
Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).
Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.
There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.
It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.","CuriosityKilledShawn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0102816/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2004","6"

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.
Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.
So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!
So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","mfisher452","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1142330/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2004",""
"","","The Matrix","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4175553/?ref_=tt_urv","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.
The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.
The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.
The special effects are good even today.

"","","Dynamite to my Brain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767095/?ref_=tt_urv","Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.
Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.
Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:

"","","Could this possibly have been any better?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2049861/?ref_=tt_urv","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to.

"","","Superb and revolutionary film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7663003/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is a superb and revolutionary film that combines multiple genres and ideas to create something unique. A thought provoking, action packed and inventive film that's impressive visual effects still almost entirely hold up.
Keanu Reeves gives a perfect lead performance that always anchors the film and keeps it grounded and focused. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are both incredible with effortlessly cool and stylish supporting performances. Hugo Weaving is a phenomenal villain who is effectively cold and calculating yet also full of rage.
The Wachowski's direction is excellent, with director of photography Bill Pope they manage to create clean and comprehensible action scenes as well as some truly mind blowing moments. The music by Don Davis is great, suitably epic and high tech with a solid soundtrack that suits the film's tone.","masonsaul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2021","10"
"","","A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7840487/?ref_=tt_urv","""What's he doing?"" ""He's beginning to believe""
When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.
The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.
So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.
The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!","SoumikBanerjee1996","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46919419/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2022","9"

That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.
Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.
The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.
I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"","","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0510974/?ref_=tt_urv","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.
Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.
The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?
That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.
The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.
Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2002",""
"","","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508891/?ref_=tt_urv","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.
This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.
If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)
The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.
One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.
Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.
There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.
All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 1999",""

"","","Generational experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520709/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.
Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"","","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508978/?ref_=tt_urv","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.
The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 1999","6"

"","","Good, but highly overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823786/?ref_=tt_urv","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.
One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.
Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.
Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","Ashrith26","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120647517/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2021","7"

You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.
Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.

"","","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039878/?ref_=tt_urv","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?
I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.
But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.
But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.
The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.
But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","meathookcinema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81729148/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2018","5"
"","","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509897/?ref_=tt_urv","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.
So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.
But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.
Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","Erewhon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0012899/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 1999","8"

I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.
You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.
The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.
It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.
I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.
I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.

Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.
I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly
The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)
Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.
To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","happytoms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81491980/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","10"

"","","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508800/?ref_=tt_urv","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.
Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.
The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.
Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.
Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","Spleen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0035229/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 1999","8"

I can recite it word for word but I couldn't tell what the words imply about the movie itself. So to rewatch it all these years later and say it holds up pretty well is very satisfying. The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","cuddlesatusc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129227154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","8"
"","","Groundbreaking thought-provoking film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657325/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix is groundbreaking and the start of the modern-day effects we see today. From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.
The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.
With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.
The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.
The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed.","akdjreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129603614/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","10"

"","","Disguised Scientology?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2314031/?ref_=tt_urv","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.
Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).
In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.
I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","s_daad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23826281/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2010","3"

"","","Life in reality","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440977/?ref_=tt_urv","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.
Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)
Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.
The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.
Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.
Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.
The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.
The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.
The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","Prismark10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","7"
"","","Even better as an adult!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5907244/?ref_=tt_urv","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.
But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.
The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!
The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

"","","HELL YEAH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509419/?ref_=tt_urv","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.
Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.
The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","Anonymous_Maxine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0562732/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2000","10"

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

"","","An iconic masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7690476/?ref_=tt_urv","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.
The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.
The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.
Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.
At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:

The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?
The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.
It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.
It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do. I really think that he makes a damn-lousy Neo. I mean - Let's face it - Reeves just isn't a very convincing bright-boy. And he makes a truly terrible lover for Trinity, too.

It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead.

"","","Laughably Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509785/?ref_=tt_urv","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.
The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.
The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.
This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.
The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since.

"","","It's been done better before","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508769/?ref_=tt_urv","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).
The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).
Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.
Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.
Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc. Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.","pooch-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0197287/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 1999",""
"","","Still the one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623958/?ref_=tt_urv","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!
Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.
I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.
Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.
It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.
Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.","southdavid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0715971/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2021","9"

And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.
I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".
Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.
The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.
Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny.

"","","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511460/?ref_=tt_urv","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.
For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?
The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).
Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.
I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.
I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.
As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","dr_foreman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1052098/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2004","4"

It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise
To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film","Theo Robertson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177/?ref_=tt_urv","28 October 2003","7"

--
I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.
The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.
As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.
But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.
Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).
Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).
But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.
""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.
""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

It is assumed that there is a reason for this boy to be chosen and the search for that reason is the root of the plot. The rest is simply a visual delight that, like a porn, does not require a larger argument to support the viewer. The only people in love with the plot are those who love conspiracies and obviously they are not the majority.

I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020. The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe. Everything, every single thing about this movie was deep & convincing, there was just no flaw that could be said about it except the fight sequences, although they're not so bad to watch even after 2 decades, which is a fabulous achievement in itself.","saru2020","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66979966/?ref_=tt_urv","4 October 2020","10"

I understand the world created represents the ones and zeroes that surround the computer world and that the computer world has become a competitor with the real world. I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.
Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.

One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action. This is the highlight of the film, and without that, it would be almost like any other science-fiction/action movie.

I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.
As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.
In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.
I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.
So,overall,I'd say The Matrix was an intelligent,original Sci-Fi movie which was a bit too long and did'nt really handle it's source material to well.So,go figure.***","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 1999",""

He knew this film was beyond him and allowing the filmmakers to showcase the film and his character was the best choice. All actors excel at their roles.

It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.
Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.
Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.
The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.
We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.
I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.","braddugg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17029428/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2014","6"

"","","Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7707902/?ref_=tt_urv","The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.
The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.
But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.
Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.","Mike_Devine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2021","8"

"","","The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1076864/?ref_=tt_urv","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.
For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.
""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.
The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.","The_Other_Snowman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4963708/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2005","2"

"","","The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7234460/?ref_=tt_urv","So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.
Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.
Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.
So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.
Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.
Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.
In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.
And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?
It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.
So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.","TheCorniestLemur","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96762914/?ref_=tt_urv","16 August 2021","9"
"","","Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7641718/?ref_=tt_urv","Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.
I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.
I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.
So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.
With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.
And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.
It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.
And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.
He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.
It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.","IQ42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76439477/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2021","5"
"","","Tedium Beyond Belief","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509902/?ref_=tt_urv","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.
The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.
The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.
For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.
People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.
Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!
This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.
BAD!

This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like this seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions and the concept, everything was awesome.
Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.
I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might seems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something like that was shown in movies.

'The Matrix' is one of my favorite films. I've seen it a dozen of times & when-ever I re-visit it, it only gets better. It's a solid entertainer, that is simply spell-binding.
Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski's Screenplay & Direction, both deserve top-honors. Their Screenplay is delicious, while, Their Direction is damn stylish. The entire execution to this box-office blockbuster deserves full marks. Action-Sequences are simply, amazing. Cinematography is flawless. Editing is neat. Art Design & Graphics are incredibly done.
Performance-Wise: Keanu Reeves as Neo, delivers one of his best performances in here. He's in top-form! Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, is fantastic! Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, is superlative. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, does well. Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, is impressive. Julian Arahanga as Apoc, is decent. Gloria Foster as the Oracle, leaves a mark.

"","","A Sci-fi classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2976171/?ref_=tt_urv","Rating-9/10
The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.
The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.
I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.
The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.
The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.
People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.
I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.","willcundallreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47850240/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2014","9"

"","","More holes than a hunk o'swiss","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509647/?ref_=tt_urv","I didn't dislike this movie.
That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.
And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.
And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.
I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.","thebishop2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0858142/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2000","6"
"","","A revolutionary movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2722173/?ref_=tt_urv","When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".

"","","A Movie with Different Layers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1929505/?ref_=tt_urv","Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.
If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.
The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.
So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.","cyberknight","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0990598/?ref_=tt_urv","13 August 2008","10"

""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive"" This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis: Will you choose blue pills or red pills? Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought. On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream. But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever.

"","","You don't know Kung-Fu.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511463/?ref_=tt_urv","One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""
Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.
My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.
Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.

Because it is really cult one. I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.
For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.
Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.
And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting.

The premise of the film, that everything we see is a computer created illusion, called ""The Matrix,"" is sheer genius, and brings in elements of post deconstruction theory as well as Baudrillard.
And, Neo is One spelled sideways.

"","","The most overrated film ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509944/?ref_=tt_urv","Yeah, the effects were good. But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script. The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead. The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots. But the fact remains that this is a poor effort. There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting. The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts. The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.
If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor. You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards. The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?""

Is the plot solid? No. The background situation is so completely improbable that it borders on the ridiculous. The justification behind the action scenes is very, very weak. The potential philosophical content (about virtual realities) is completely ignored - unlike in Thirteenth Floor, for example. The symbolism is so heavy and cheap (Trinity, Neo = One, etc.) that it truly stinks.
And then you've got tons of ridiculous stuff going on. For example, within that virtual reality the heroes still have to use a heavy mobile phone to call home. And then they cannot be ""beamed"" from that cell phone, no, they have to go to a fixed line phone - how very likely and logical!

Another great scene is Neo and Trinity are in a white area room, he asks the Matrix for guns and you see infinite amount of guns appear. It's cool because anything you desire can appear to you in a snap.

"","","More fun than summer vacation.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509784/?ref_=tt_urv","I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.
Granted, it is a great story. Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great. But oh what a concept. Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures. But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.
The fight scenes are spectacular. Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it. Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side. And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.
Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted. His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving. I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.
My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy. ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills. I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak. I think that story line could have used a little work. Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.

"","","Ignore the sequels, this is The One","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1693090/?ref_=tt_urv","""The Matrix"" is the driving force behind a string of half-arsed sci-fi/fantasy films (including 2 bloated and inferior Matrix sequels) that have appeared (and sunk without trace) in its wake since 1999. This film had a similar cultural impact to the original ""Star Wars"" and its high rating is well deserved. Often imitated but seldom equaled, ""The Matrix"" set so many new standards that it became sci-fi's yardstick for the new millennium.
It has that potent blend of action, adventure, philosophy and sex appeal that distinguishes a classic blockbuster movie from all the summer season also-rans. Name me one other big-hitting action movie from 1999. You're struggling, aren't you?
Of course you are. ""The Matrix"" was one of the first films to use ""Bullet Time"" camera effects in its gravity-defying slow-motion stunts. The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes. The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the figure-hugging shiny black PVC?
""The Matrix"" is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the formulaic sequels haven't dimmed the appeal of the original film.","extravaluejotter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8345459/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2007","7"
"","","Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509838/?ref_=tt_urv","People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again.
It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.
There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story.

"","","My big disappointment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509624/?ref_=tt_urv","I must say that I am a small admirer of sci-fi movies. Nevertheless, I have always liked good action, even if it happens in outer space. I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi. My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane.

"","","I know this will be unpopular","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511412/?ref_=tt_urv","OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.
First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequels
However, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.
Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.
Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?

"","","A gorgeous film that demands subsequent discussion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1451806/?ref_=tt_urv","I've put off writing this review for ages because I feel as though I could never do a classic like The Matrix (1999) justice. I happily panned Matrix: Revolutions as a disappointing end to a fantastic trilogy, but I dare not touch the original film. There is no way I could capture its innovative brilliance on paper, because the film is a visual experience. So I'll just throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.
I imagine that when the Wachowski brothers approached the film studio with a storyline that went something like this: ""a hacker in the near future discovers that the universe and the world he is living in is nothing more than a dream--and elaborate computer programme called the Matrix controlled by machines as a means to dominate humanity"" all they got were raised eyebrows from executives. Yet, somehow, they must have convinced them to finance the project, because The Matrix is 65 million dollar production, sparing no expense at glorious visual effects and science fiction elements.
It puts forward totalitarian ideas like many dystopian films, but it adds more depth to them, more philosophy and more relevant notions. What's more is that it approaches and treats these in a much more effective way. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how, but most of its content is communicated through dialogue (Morpheus telling Neo about the Matrix and what it means) and stunning visuals. Just like Terminator, it tells us that A.I. will grow stronger and eventually spiral into thinking minds of its own, leading to the demise of mankind. Unlike Terminator however, The Matrix tells us the machines are hiding this fact, creating an illusion. We are living in a dream world. That is enough to make you question a few things.
The Matrix catalyzed a whole new style of film-making and it is referenced to, spoofed and homaged in literally hundreds of films just a couple of years after its release in 1999. Even children's animations like Shrek features Matrix segments (Fiona rising in the air Trinity-style, battling forest rangers). So it is safe to say this film has had considerable influence on contemporary films.
As the trilogy drags on, the novelty of the fresh science fiction mixture and special effects has worn off; the ideas are no longer as riveting; the story itself becomes too widely-scoped to grasp and with an opening films of such flair, it is setting itself up for disappointment. But The Matrix alone is a near-perfect film.

"","","Overrated, but still excellent entertainment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0975037/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember, back in 1999 (or it could have been the start of 2000), when I first saw The Matrix. It was big, bold, loud, exciting...it had guns, bullet time, Rage Against the Machine, plenty of action, a hot woman in a lead role....I remember thinking ""I should like this"". But I didn't. Like Kill Bill, it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye, drop it on the floor and stand on it, but it's true. OK, it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill, apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish, but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at.
Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today, and the rewatch. I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad, because I watch movies for enjoyment (nobody watches movies to be bored) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment, then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad. And I enjoyed The Matrix.
However, I maintain that it's not a great film.
Now, if Pulp fiction has taught us anything; it's that it isn't what you take, it's what you do with it....but by god, the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski Bandits
For a start; the film is Star Wars reincarnated. Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force, and he even has everyone doubting him for a while(!), Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her...him, the bad guys have taken over the galaxy...I mean the world, and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it, they go and see Yoda...I mean the Oracle, who predicts the future and stuff, there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back, Neo must become one with the force, whoops, i mean 'believe', Agent Smith is Neo's father...oh, OK I made that last one up, but you see what I'm getting at.
And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off, The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either. Of course, they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal, as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands, but he is just another version of liquid metal really...isn't he? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone. And what about the whole 'computers take over the world' thing, you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you?
And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists, because even shitty movies aren't safe. What about the whole SN thing? The way that the hackers are made to look cool....Hackers anyone?
But like I said, it isn't what you take; it's what you do with it. Just like Tarantino did, Bonnie and Clyde...I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements, and mixed them up into one coherent, and trend setting piece of cinema. Also like Tarantino, The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen, they've made some stuff themselves as well. Bullet time, for a start. Of course, it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer; but still. Also, the idea of the 'matrix' itself is an original one. (unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen/heard of)
The soundtrack fits too, which is rare when it's mostly rave/heavy rock music. I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked. Anyway, when Rage's ""Wake Up"" came on before the credit sequence, it fit very well. Also, the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music. In fact, that might even be my favourite scene in the movie. It's cool and it works. In fact, the film does ooze a sense of cool throughout, mostly because of the leather jackets.
It's not a complete piece of cinema, however. I don't know if it's built upon in the sequels, but there isn't a lot of emotion in the movie. Sometimes, it doesn't matter, some of the best films of all time are very cold on that front; my top 2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Evil Dead both are; but then again, they didn't try and be soul searching or have a great depth like The Matrix does. For an example of what I'm talking about; the love between Trinity and Neo. I noticed her saying she is watching him at the start, but other than, the love seemed to be based on the fact that the Oracle said it would happen....so I'm supposed to care? In fact, none of the characters seemed to have any depth, or anything about them at all. What drives them? Why does Morpheus blindly believe that Neo is 'The One'? Why did Neo take the red pill? Is it his character? I don't know.
Also of note is the way that people seem to refer to The Matrix as a confusing film. It uses a non-linear style of storytelling (it runs straight, but you don't find everything out all at once), and that's the only confusing thing about it. When you think about it, it's very simple.
There isn't a great deal of depth, and the film doesn't pose any real thought-provoking questions either. Of course, there's the central theme; ""it's all an illusion"", but what does that mean? Of course, it's not all an illusion really...so what's the message? Don't build too many machines? There is a central question, though, which is ""would you take the blue or the red pill""...and that's not a bad question; but the film, through it's non-linear storytelling and imaginative premise, isn't as deep as it appears to be. Bit like Fight Club really. Of course, the premise in The Matrix does get you thinking in a ""what if..."" frame of mind, but so do lots of things, like on British TV show, Kenyan Confronts; when he exposes credit card scams etc...""what if mine was stolen"", so does that make Kenyan Confronts a deep and complex masterpiece?
(By the way, did anyone think that Lawrence Fishbourne looked stupid during his 'believe' type moments?)
Still, like I said; the film is entertaining. The action sequences are stunning and the film looks lovely throughout, so it gets itself high marks for that. It's well paced as well, and unlike a lot of action films; the non-action scenes in The Matrix aren't boring. But that's all; it's like Song 2 (""wuhoo!"") or the ""Belly's gonna get you"" advert; fun, but not overly brilliant. However, I'm 'down' with fun films, so I'm down with this.","The_Void","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2248099/?ref_=tt_urv","8 December 2004","8"

"","","The return of internal consistency in plotting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509904/?ref_=tt_urv","... but considering the quality of writing these days, it won't return again for awhile. This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it: the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.
This is a film that chronicles the style of the turn of this century in the same way that ""Georgy Girl"" caught the London of the 1960's, and that ""Laura"" captured the deco-elegant look of the 1940's.","occupant-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1278016/?ref_=tt_urv","3 September 2001","7"
"","","Expertly blends both style and substance","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7658812/?ref_=tt_urv","A burn-out computer hacker, Neo, suddenly finds himself pursued by both law-enforcement and a mysterious underground group. Unsure as to why he has become so sought after, he decides to place his allegiances with the latter. After a number of trials and tribulations, Neo is brought face-to-face with Morpheus, the leader of the said group and he is awakened to a reality he had no idea existed: the world, as we know it, is an illusion. Neo has been participating in a virtual reality created by intelligent robots, robots who defeated human beings in a war waged many years ago. This virtual reality is known as the Matrix, and it exists so that the robots can keep their former human masters docile and unobstructive. The machines also profit from using comatose human beings as a power-source for their real world. This discovery by itself proves to be understandably challenging for Neo to accept, but there is more.
Morpheus and his crew exist in very hostile times. They are part of a small, besieged human resistance and Neo is possibly their most important recruit. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will deliver human beings to victory and see them finally conquer their robot overlords. There is no sacrifice Morpheus is not willing to make in order for this to come to pass but is Morpheus' unshakable belief a reflection of reality or is he fatally mistaken?
This iconic movie has filtered its way into the public consciousness and even into the English language. The transitive verb ""to red-pill"" is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as ""to cause (someone) to have their perspective dramatically transformed, especially by introducing them to a new and typically disturbing understanding of the true nature of a particular situation"", which is what Morpheus does to Neo, literally offering him a red pill, which he should take if he wishes to discover the truth. The imagination underpinning the film's story is quite frankly ingenious. The Wachowskis effortlessly weave together sci-fi and philosophy to create a compelling, mind-bending backdrop that can not fail to engage the viewer.
As well as having a rich narrative, the film also excels in its delivery of action set-pieces. Using wire-technology borrowed from Hong Kong action films, the fight sequences look genuinely larger-than-life. The visual effects are also quite simply sublime with particularly impressive use of slow-motion. Then there is the costume design: iconic leather jackets and black shades provide a no-nonsense panache to this band of freedom fighters. They are not just machine battling warriors, they're stylish heroes who you can not help but route for.
My one criticism of the film is that its characters lack complexity. This doesn't hurt the film too much as it is excellently cast: the three main characters are expertly played with control and charisma, while Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, and Joe Pantaliano, as Cypher, work miracles with the limited material they are given in their supporting roles. However, it does limit the film in regard to the rest of the supporting cast, who are utterly forgettable due to the lack of nuance and development written into their characters. Although this is not a fatal flaw, it does matter, in my view, as we are supposed to be rooting for the entirety of humanity not just the three main characters. If the majority of the humans in the film lack any meaningful human qualities, the idea of robot domination does risk becoming less devastating.
That notwithstanding, overall, the film is a wonderfully enthralling and entertaining experience. It's a thoroughly modern take on Joseph Campbell's hero's journey and it holds up just as well over 20 years after its initial release. Let's see how well the latest instalment fairs.","YellowManReanimated","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7976498/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","9"
"","","This movie is one of the very few greats","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7546343/?ref_=tt_urv","I remember seeing this film at the drive-in when I was 10 years old.. I was blown away. Not because the special effects were AMAZING (Which they still hold up to this day) but because the story was/is so deep. There are a million ways you could dice this film apart or you can just sit back and let it do the talking for you.
I am SO honored to have been alive for this film's release and it lead me on the path I'm on today. Truly brilliant. Everyone who was a part of making this deserves so much praise..
It's taken me a long time to ""review"" this film on here and honestly, having had an IMDb account for 20+ years now I don't know why I never did.
I think the studio was distracted with its success because it seems that the sequels were all about the slow motion and visual effects... what was TRULY incredible about this film was the story. The VFX just helped.

"","","Good, but...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0508606/?ref_=tt_urv","I side with the negative crowd on this one; with the risk of sounding pompous I have to say this: To believe that this is a brilliant film suggest a low level of education and an underdeveloped personal philosophy. There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did. The whole thing just isn't half as clever and original as it wants to be.","giant_fish","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0281000/?ref_=tt_urv","4 July 1999","1"
"","","Awful mixture","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509950/?ref_=tt_urv","Something sad happened with this film. The Hollywood Academy give it some Oscar (special effects, I think). So young people newcomer to cinema world thought it must be a good picture. They did not know that not all the winning Oscar movies deserve it. It is a deceitful, spurious and incredibly pretentious film. Because one thing is Cinema and another thing are computers. If you want to said something in cinema' way you must use cinematography ways. Cinematography language has got his own implements. It is a very old discovery (more than 100 years old) and it was marching on and growing up with hard work, effort, wisdom and -many times- talent. Never with computers. The film responsible commit in my opinion a unforgivable lack os respect. It seen they does not know authors like Griffith, Chaplin, Stroheim, Sternberg, Welles, Dreyer, Ford, Hawks, Walsh, Curtiz, Lang, Reed, Renoir, Buñuel, Kurosawa, Wilder... All of them (and some more) made films with his own effort. Not with computers. That is why the film is not sci-fi nor comic nor martial arts catalogue.

"","","A watchable action sci-fi movie that was and still is over-hyped...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7671094/?ref_=tt_urv","I sat down here in 2021 to re-watch the 1999 action sci-fi movie ""The Matrix"". Of course I have seen it before, back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again, prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.
I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure, I found the movie to be watchable, but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999, and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.
Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive, no doubt about it. And even today, 22 years later, the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.
Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble, because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie, but then again, he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now, back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving, but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light, because he did so rather phenomenally, and always was the star of the movie.
I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise, nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good, and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script, then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.
My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars.","paul_haakonsen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2021","6"
"","","A very good movie...but a bit overrated.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511157/?ref_=tt_urv","I gave this movie a solid 8, but I definitely have seen plenty of movies that I have enjoyed more over the years. What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original. What is original about it? It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves. Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale. Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being. So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment. Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix. Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring. The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, ""Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick"". The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick. Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either. Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't. I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it. Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her? Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better. She isn't very good looking either. All in all it is worth checking out cause of the great action at the end, and because Hugo Weaving is great as the villain.","Aaron1375","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1111192/?ref_=tt_urv","7 March 2003","8"

"","","Astonishing Modern Myth-Making","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511158/?ref_=tt_urv","At its deepest level, The Matrix ponders the question of human alienation, a problem first contemplated by Karl Marx. Although Marx's answer was insufficient, based as it was on an unrealistically sanguine view of human nature, the problem remains just the same: we are all slaves to a machine like system that sucks the very life out of us.
Ezra Pond described our current life in Postindustrial society so well in a few lines of verse: `This thing, that hath a code and not a core, has set acquaintance where might be affection, and nothing now disturbeth its reflections.' A code and not a core: I once had a boss, as I'm sure we all have, who had a code and not a core, a puny man who treated himself, and others, as little machines  nothing more than isolated parts of the larger machine. As if a cruel joke by the almighty, this man's surname happened to be `Lord,' which compelled him to refer to himself in the third person as `The Lord.' He had a code but not a core. In The Matrix, the machine code of cybernetic self-regulated social development is not only non-human, it is anti-human; and people who have lost their souls to conform, who have codes instead of cores, are the norm and not the exception. It's as prophetic as old Elijah himself.
What I love about this film is the solution it presents. The answer is not found in a radical change of human nature, which isn't possible, or in technology, which would be like adding fuel to the fire. Instead, borrowing from Plato's cave metaphor, which says, basically, that the world of matter we perceive with our five senses is an illusion, a mere reflection of a deeper, more permanent, reality, The Matrix also takes Augustine's belief that the road to God runs within (the whole `Zion' motif), and places the divine act of creation the very hands of humans. Rilke thought that we are dreams in the mind of God. According to The Matrix, however, God is a dream in the minds of men. The power of human imagination makes it so. In this scenario, Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, is the voice in the wilderness who cries `prepare the way of the Lord.'
The Matrix is an astonishing piece of modern myth making. This is what great film is all about. If you haven't seen it in a while, it may be time for another look.","csm23","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1703852/?ref_=tt_urv","7 March 2003",""
