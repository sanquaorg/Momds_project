The special effects are seamlessly integrated with the narrative, making the film feel like a true space odyssey.

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film. A must watch.","castanedarobert-07211","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110594471/?ref_=tt_urv","26 August 2021","10"

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film. A must watch.","castanedarobert-07211","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110594471/?ref_=tt_urv","26 August 2021","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.

If you think about watching this movie I just have one advice for you and that is ""Yes"" Even me being 17 years old and don't as nuch experience watching movies as an fourty year old would have I can say that this is a masterpiece.","roycaspers","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110017551/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2020","10"

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you.

Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

Lots of know-it-all wannabe scientists pointing out absurdities and plot holes. First off, this is not a documentary but a work of fiction. It is not being taught in schools as part of a science curriculum. Lol. So everyone can just relax on that point.
What we do get is a beautiful film with touching storylines and an exploration of intriguing scientific ideas, many of which are supported or at the very least, have not necessarily been ruled out as impossible. If you don't believe me, search Neil deGrasse Tyson's views on the film.","katgurl81","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12202223/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2019","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also.

Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Interstellar fascinated me from the first time I saw it. And many more have followed.
The theory of how love is the most powerful force in the universe, and how they try to give a scientific explanation based on astrophysics and gravity, I find fascinating. Apart from that, the narrative and editing is impressive. How they play with time, with rhythm, I find it wonderful. Visual poetry is present throughout every scene, along with a beautiful soundtrack.
It seems to me a complete movie, adventure, thriller, mystery, science fiction, discovery, psychology, and above all LOVE.","guillembarcelo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127901212/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","10"

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made.

In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Interstellar fascinated me from the first time I saw it. And many more have followed.
The theory of how love is the most powerful force in the universe, and how they try to give a scientific explanation based on astrophysics and gravity, I find fascinating. Apart from that, the narrative and editing is impressive. How they play with time, with rhythm, I find it wonderful. Visual poetry is present throughout every scene, along with a beautiful soundtrack.
It seems to me a complete movie, adventure, thriller, mystery, science fiction, discovery, psychology, and above all LOVE.","guillembarcelo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127901212/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","10"

The special effects are seamlessly integrated with the narrative, making the film feel like a true space odyssey.
In conclusion, Interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of what science fiction movies can achieve. Its intricate plot, stunning visuals, and emotive performances combine to create a truly unforgettable movie experience. In my opinion, it is one of the best movies of all time and a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of film.","MR4V","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur103188680/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2023","10"

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason. Please spare 3 hours and enjoy some of the best screen time your ever going to witness.","ummer-51499","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur108445078/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2020","10"

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now. Interstellar is a surely must watch a movie for a sci-fi movie lovers and one of best of all time. you will never regret it after watching it. My biggest regret is i never got chance to watch this movie in cinema.","neerajmanjhi-59996","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur115819418/?ref_=tt_urv","3 April 2020","9"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Benchmark for sci-fi movies!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5638981/?ref_=tt_urv","A visually stimulating blockbuster will leave you pondering about the vast and mysterious expanse of space. The use of Hans Zimmer's musical genius adds to the high-risk high reward action prevalent across the entire film that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The insightful opinion on the mechanics of space-time and gravity (backed by the mental genius of Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Kip Thorne) is fascinating and mind-bending. For those uninterested in the phenomena of space, the beautiful storytelling at the base of this movie, such as the father-daughter relationship, or the feeling of ultimate betrayal will leave viewers leaving the theater exhilarated as disembark from the emotional rollercoaster this movie is. 10/10 for me and a job well done for all those involved in the making of this movie (and of course special thanks to Christopher Nolan's enthralling storytelling).","somnath796","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116617832/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2020","10"

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you. First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

A group of astronauts travels through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind. The main character, Cooper, is a former engineer, he works as a farmer to provide for his family. Cooper wants to save people so he goes to deep space.
Advantage of this film is that it teaches people and gives them new information about universe. It's real-life movie, because we can face the same problems in the future. In my opinion ""Interstellar"", doesn't have cons.
This movie made me think about our insignificance in this world and about things that we will know in the future by technical progress.","dmggzht","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131617177/?ref_=tt_urv","21 April 2021","9"

Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet... This is the main synopsis offered to us, but as always in the film we will see either more of what is in the trailer.","iezhov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551607/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

It is impossible to describe into what world of pleasure this picture immerses the viewer.

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes.

The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.
It is a movie worth watching and deserves more rating. You should watch it, promise you won't regret it!.","ivantur-92667","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur113261001/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2023","10"

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now. Interstellar is a surely must watch a movie for a sci-fi movie lovers and one of best of all time. you will never regret it after watching it.

The insightful opinion on the mechanics of space-time and gravity (backed by the mental genius of Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Kip Thorne) is fascinating and mind-bending. For those uninterested in the phenomena of space, the beautiful storytelling at the base of this movie, such as the father-daughter relationship, or the feeling of ultimate betrayal will leave viewers leaving the theater exhilarated as disembark from the emotional rollercoaster this movie is. 10/10 for me and a job well done for all those involved in the making of this movie (and of course special thanks to Christopher Nolan's enthralling storytelling).","somnath796","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116617832/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2020","10"

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you.

Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Interstellar fascinated me from the first time I saw it. And many more have followed.
The theory of how love is the most powerful force in the universe, and how they try to give a scientific explanation based on astrophysics and gravity, I find fascinating. Apart from that, the narrative and editing is impressive. How they play with time, with rhythm, I find it wonderful. Visual poetry is present throughout every scene, along with a beautiful soundtrack.
It seems to me a complete movie, adventure, thriller, mystery, science fiction, discovery, psychology, and above all LOVE.","guillembarcelo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127901212/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","10"

Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet...

It is impossible to describe into what world of pleasure this picture immerses the viewer.

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

If you forgot the school course, I want to note that you will not find anything about it in textbooks, do not forget that time as such was invented by us, another technique for measuring distances between celestial bodies, so such plot twists are a figment of fantasy no more, akin to a witch hunt in the Middle Ages. Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also with an emotional story that lies in its very soul. This is a film not only about discoveries, space exploration and the last frontier of humanity, but also about the relationship of a father and daughter who got into a difficult life situation when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that cannot be underestimated. The genius with which Nolan unfolds this action in front of us is beyond praise. Combining a story filled not only with grounded science fiction, but also with true human values and emotions, a breathtaking visual series, an epic and dramatic soundtrack. Delight!","yakovlevdmk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148667522/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Back in 2014, I went to the cinema for a film that became venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched him ""The Beginning"". He became one of my favorite directors of our time. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the corners of the filmed films, this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
In fact, this film tried to combine real scientific research about gravity, space-time and movement in it, Einstein's theory of relativity and show not only science fiction, but also a drama about the relationship of people on the verge of the Apocalypse.
I rate this film very highly, my respects to the director)","russiontank","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148676638/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you. First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

The cast is nothing short of superb, they really brought everything to life. I'm sure the budget for this one was insane as each scene took me deeper into my own imagination.
Without giving too much away if you're really into SCI-FI this is the film for you! Even if you aren't I think those who enjoy a good maze of astonishment and brain bending uncertainty could find this film enjoyable.","DanielleMeggoe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127232924/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2022","10"

If you have not watched this yet you probably should stop reading this and start watching it right now. It is an out of the world movie, even physically. No such space movie has ever been taken in this way. The wormhole transports not only the cast but also your mind to a whole new level. I dont want to be a spoiler but I assure you that you will get goosebumps after their trip to the first planet. It is a MUST WATCH.

Interstellar fascinated me from the first time I saw it. And many more have followed.
The theory of how love is the most powerful force in the universe, and how they try to give a scientific explanation based on astrophysics and gravity, I find fascinating. Apart from that, the narrative and editing is impressive. How they play with time, with rhythm, I find it wonderful. Visual poetry is present throughout every scene, along with a beautiful soundtrack.
It seems to me a complete movie, adventure, thriller, mystery, science fiction, discovery, psychology, and above all LOVE.","guillembarcelo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127901212/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","10"

Advantage of this film is that it teaches people and gives them new information about universe. It's real-life movie, because we can face the same problems in the future. In my opinion ""Interstellar"", doesn't have cons.

I personally am in love with this film and rate it 10 out of 10! Thank you, Nolan. Thank you, Hans!","IvanBobyrew","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551397/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet... This is the main synopsis offered to us, but as always in the film we will see either more of what is in the trailer.","iezhov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551607/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

It is impossible to describe into what world of pleasure this picture immerses the viewer.

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

If you forgot the school course, I want to note that you will not find anything about it in textbooks, do not forget that time as such was invented by us, another technique for measuring distances between celestial bodies, so such plot twists are a figment of fantasy no more, akin to a witch hunt in the Middle Ages. Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

Back in 2014, I went to the cinema for a film that became venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched him ""The Beginning"". He became one of my favorite directors of our time. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the corners of the filmed films, this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
In fact, this film tried to combine real scientific research about gravity, space-time and movement in it, Einstein's theory of relativity and show not only science fiction, but also a drama about the relationship of people on the verge of the Apocalypse.

Just give heed to extraordinary directorial skills of Nolan the way he shot space travel sequences which looks so real that you can feel them . Memorable performances by Mathew Mcconnaughy , Jessica chastin , Michael Caine , matt Damon . The moment when Cooper left the earth for space mission and then checks the logs of past years he found that his little daughter is of his age now , that leave everyone in teary eyes , his promise to his daughter that when they will meet again she will be of his age she is saying that's right time dad to come back .

This is truly the best movie I have ever watched. EVER. Its so underrated, especially by people who just want Michael Bay-esque explosions with incoherent plots.
It's intelligent. You can tell that it was written by an intelligent person who got help from other intelligent people. The science is so sound even after 7 years and I have never had a single reason to criticise the movie or its production.
The soundtrack is epic. Every time I listen to it, I get goosebumps remembering certain scenes in the movie and the way they left me in the edge of my seat, especially the 'no time for caution' scene!
The characters and their mission are so believable and relatable. There are times when you feel like an explorer yourself and imagine what you'd do in certain situations; this being the hallmark of a truly immersive movie.
The plot was both complicated and very simple at the same time, allowing for enjoyment despite the level you watch it at (unlike tenet).
Its still a fantastic watch anyday, anytime. Especially with the terrible content Hollywood is churning these days, it's a little reassuring to know that great writers and directors still exist.
All in all, a resounding 10/10.","emad-28284","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156537261/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2022","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Fantastically beautiful, masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8530642/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is the most significant and remarkable film of recent years in the science fiction genre.
The plot contains various elements which allow the audiences to follow up, whether it is family drama, philosophical aspects and science technology. The scenarios are narrated upon actuality logic through creative imagination of the directors, the Nolan brothers. While the film is full of science fiction and slang about a black hole, the fifth dimension, the film was great in terms of how they portray the story easier and smoothly. I would say that instead of getting entangled in the wild twists and turns of astrophysics, you collect a handful of scientific knowledge at home without knowing it.
Apart from the plot, what should not be left out are the messages which engrave in the story. The intimate relationship between a single dad, Cooper and two of his children, Murph and Tom is pure and powerful. Cooper has to sacrifice basic human desires; home and love ones in hope not only to save millions of people but also find a promising future for his kids. It represents tender tale of love and loss. Matthew McConaughey's performance as a main actor is undeniably first class with voice trembling in the sentimental scenes. Anne Hathaway is also serving up well as a support actress, even though she is not the main one.
For visual and effects, Nolan used anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm cameras with a tall aspect ratio during the process while switching location from one country to another. Other than that, to reduce the use of computer graphic, he had practical locations built such as the interior of space shuttle.
Besides, the soundtracks of Interstellar were composed by Hans Zimmer which has previously worked with Nolan before. The genre of these soundtracks are cotemporary classic and also minimal but sentimental. He also used booming music in most of the scenes to build up excitement level of the audiences.
Interstellar brings together different kind of feelings; sadness, impressive and emotional feelings, but what thrilled me the most was realizing about the impact and power of love as it is beyond all reasons and rules in the universe. In my opinion, this film is worth giving a go, just because of movie is great and so realistic.","saule-27695","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156633140/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2022","10"

A group of astronauts go to space for Saturn to move the world into the saturn. And in the movie, he also explained his difference during his time in space. The separation of a father and his dougther was also the emotional side of the movie. Although it is a science fiction movie, it made the audience experience every emotion.

The cinematography and special effects are stunning, making for a visually breathtaking experience.
One of the strengths of ""Interstellar"" is its attention to scientific accuracy, which is uncommon in most science fiction movies. The film is grounded in scientific concepts such as relativity and time dilation, which makes the story more believable and engaging. The film also explores deeper philosophical themes, such as the nature of human existence and the meaning of life.
However, some critics have pointed out that the film's plot can be convoluted and confusing at times, which may be a barrier to some viewers' enjoyment. Additionally, some of the scientific concepts and theories explored in the movie may be challenging for some viewers to understand.
Overall, ""Interstellar"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking film that tackles complex themes in a visually stunning and engaging way. While it may not be for everyone, it is definitely worth watching for fans of science fiction and those interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe.","katyakulyzhka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur162272700/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2023","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","A real masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8908145/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.
From the very first scene, Interstellar is an incredibly immersive and breathtaking cinematic experience. The film's stunning visuals, paired with Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score, create an otherworldly atmosphere that draws the viewer in and never lets go.
One of the most impressive aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of complex scientific concepts such as relativity, time dilation, and the theory of gravity. These ideas are woven seamlessly into the film's narrative, adding a layer of intellectual depth that is often missing in mainstream Hollywood films.
The film's cast is also exceptional. Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut who must grapple with the emotional toll of leaving his family behind in order to save humanity. Anne Hathaway is equally impressive as Dr. Brand, a brilliant scientist who must confront the harsh realities of space travel.
Perhaps the most emotionally resonant aspect of Interstellar is its examination of the relationships between the characters. The bond between Cooper and his daughter, Murph (played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain), is at the heart of the film's story, and their interactions are both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.
At its core, Interstellar is a film about humanity's place in the universe and the choices we must make in order to survive. The film's themes of sacrifice, love, and the power of human connection are explored with depth and nuance, making for a truly profound viewing experience.
Overall, I would give Interstellar 10 out of 10 stars. It is a masterpiece of science fiction filmmaking, and one that will stay with me for a long time. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself to be a visionary director, and the film's exceptional cast and technical achievements make it a must-see for anyone who loves cinema. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch - you won't be disappointed.","silviomalvestio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163000476/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2023","10"

Originally watched this in cinema when it came out. I remember walking out the cinema knowing there'll never be another movie made to this level. Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason. Please spare 3 hours and enjoy some of the best screen time your ever going to witness.","ummer-51499","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur108445078/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2020","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","The best ending I've ever watched!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8625163/?ref_=tt_urv","It's my most favourite movie of Nolan. And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: A compete experience.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5684480/?ref_=tt_urv","What was I thinking after seeing Interstellar? It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you. First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

I came here because of the director being none other than Nolan, but I left with a mind blowing experience of a brilliant storytelling. Today was a lazy rest day so I decided to finally see for myself this acclaimed gem of a movie... and it proved itself to be deserving of all the praise. Easily one of the best movies on my list.

Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet... This is the main synopsis offered to us, but as always in the film we will see either more of what is in the trailer.","iezhov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551607/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Why did I point out that this is not science fiction, primarily because of the idea of time travel, because of traveling through some fantasized cosmic windows, and the metaphor of transmitting information through space and time using bookshelves did not seem to me the best, exposing the audience to idiots! If you forgot the school course, I want to note that you will not find anything about it in textbooks, do not forget that time as such was invented by us, another technique for measuring distances between celestial bodies, so such plot twists are a figment of fantasy no more, akin to a witch hunt in the Middle Ages. Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

Back in 2014, I went to the cinema for a film that became venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched him ""The Beginning"". He became one of my favorite directors of our time. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the corners of the filmed films, this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
In fact, this film tried to combine real scientific research about gravity, space-time and movement in it, Einstein's theory of relativity and show not only science fiction, but also a drama about the relationship of people on the verge of the Apocalypse.

This is truly the best movie I have ever watched. EVER. Its so underrated, especially by people who just want Michael Bay-esque explosions with incoherent plots.
It's intelligent. You can tell that it was written by an intelligent person who got help from other intelligent people. The science is so sound even after 7 years and I have never had a single reason to criticise the movie or its production.
The soundtrack is epic. Every time I listen to it, I get goosebumps remembering certain scenes in the movie and the way they left me in the edge of my seat, especially the 'no time for caution' scene!
The characters and their mission are so believable and relatable. There are times when you feel like an explorer yourself and imagine what you'd do in certain situations; this being the hallmark of a truly immersive movie.
The plot was both complicated and very simple at the same time, allowing for enjoyment despite the level you watch it at (unlike tenet).
Its still a fantastic watch anyday, anytime. Especially with the terrible content Hollywood is churning these days, it's a little reassuring to know that great writers and directors still exist.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Fantastically beautiful, masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8530642/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is the most significant and remarkable film of recent years in the science fiction genre.
The plot contains various elements which allow the audiences to follow up, whether it is family drama, philosophical aspects and science technology. The scenarios are narrated upon actuality logic through creative imagination of the directors, the Nolan brothers. While the film is full of science fiction and slang about a black hole, the fifth dimension, the film was great in terms of how they portray the story easier and smoothly. I would say that instead of getting entangled in the wild twists and turns of astrophysics, you collect a handful of scientific knowledge at home without knowing it.
Apart from the plot, what should not be left out are the messages which engrave in the story. The intimate relationship between a single dad, Cooper and two of his children, Murph and Tom is pure and powerful. Cooper has to sacrifice basic human desires; home and love ones in hope not only to save millions of people but also find a promising future for his kids. It represents tender tale of love and loss. Matthew McConaughey's performance as a main actor is undeniably first class with voice trembling in the sentimental scenes. Anne Hathaway is also serving up well as a support actress, even though she is not the main one.
For visual and effects, Nolan used anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm cameras with a tall aspect ratio during the process while switching location from one country to another. Other than that, to reduce the use of computer graphic, he had practical locations built such as the interior of space shuttle.
Besides, the soundtracks of Interstellar were composed by Hans Zimmer which has previously worked with Nolan before. The genre of these soundtracks are cotemporary classic and also minimal but sentimental. He also used booming music in most of the scenes to build up excitement level of the audiences.
Interstellar brings together different kind of feelings; sadness, impressive and emotional feelings, but what thrilled me the most was realizing about the impact and power of love as it is beyond all reasons and rules in the universe. In my opinion, this film is worth giving a go, just because of movie is great and so realistic.","saule-27695","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156633140/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2022","10"

The plot, the cast, the special effects..everything about it is incredible. I can't really explain the movie because it has a strange plot. It is a film that tells the world we live in is getting worse and that if it continues like this, there will be no life in the world. A group of astronauts go to space for Saturn to move the world into the saturn. And in the movie, he also explained his difference during his time in space. The separation of a father and his dougther was also the emotional side of the movie. Although it is a science fiction movie, it made the audience experience every emotion. This movie has directed from the famous director christopher nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain , Anne Hathaway. Also the movie has a oscara nominee.

the movie is not as complex as people make it sound but trust me if you watch this with good observation you are going to enjoy every single second.
Another masterpiece by nolan, the acting was on point. Only thing that lacks in the film is pacing could have improved it a bit but it is fine.

The cinematography and special effects are stunning, making for a visually breathtaking experience.
One of the strengths of ""Interstellar"" is its attention to scientific accuracy, which is uncommon in most science fiction movies. The film is grounded in scientific concepts such as relativity and time dilation, which makes the story more believable and engaging. The film also explores deeper philosophical themes, such as the nature of human existence and the meaning of life.
However, some critics have pointed out that the film's plot can be convoluted and confusing at times, which may be a barrier to some viewers' enjoyment. Additionally, some of the scientific concepts and theories explored in the movie may be challenging for some viewers to understand.
Overall, ""Interstellar"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking film that tackles complex themes in a visually stunning and engaging way. While it may not be for everyone, it is definitely worth watching for fans of science fiction and those interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe.","katyakulyzhka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur162272700/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2023","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","A real masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8908145/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.
From the very first scene, Interstellar is an incredibly immersive and breathtaking cinematic experience. The film's stunning visuals, paired with Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score, create an otherworldly atmosphere that draws the viewer in and never lets go.
One of the most impressive aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of complex scientific concepts such as relativity, time dilation, and the theory of gravity. These ideas are woven seamlessly into the film's narrative, adding a layer of intellectual depth that is often missing in mainstream Hollywood films.
The film's cast is also exceptional. Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut who must grapple with the emotional toll of leaving his family behind in order to save humanity. Anne Hathaway is equally impressive as Dr. Brand, a brilliant scientist who must confront the harsh realities of space travel.
Perhaps the most emotionally resonant aspect of Interstellar is its examination of the relationships between the characters. The bond between Cooper and his daughter, Murph (played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain), is at the heart of the film's story, and their interactions are both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.
At its core, Interstellar is a film about humanity's place in the universe and the choices we must make in order to survive. The film's themes of sacrifice, love, and the power of human connection are explored with depth and nuance, making for a truly profound viewing experience.
Overall, I would give Interstellar 10 out of 10 stars. It is a masterpiece of science fiction filmmaking, and one that will stay with me for a long time. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself to be a visionary director, and the film's exceptional cast and technical achievements make it a must-see for anyone who loves cinema. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch - you won't be disappointed.","silviomalvestio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163000476/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2023","10"

It seems to me that the narrative structure is perfectly embodied that as much as it is difficult to understand how the theory of time and time lag works, it is still understandable and it is something that as an audience I enjoy very much, that the films are complex but perfectly explained to the extent that the complex becomes simple in the best way.","natjeza","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163195266/?ref_=tt_urv","11 March 2023","10"

My friend and I wanted to watch a movie together and she had asked if I've ever watched it and I haven't so we did and I am SO GLAD that we did.
The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics and special effects are beautiful, the music is so flipping good and emotional, and the ACTING, especially Cooper, is phenomenal.
Rarely does a movie make me feel as many emotions as this one did.
The music made me feel amazing, it made me feel scared as all living hell, it did so well at making you /feel/ and so did the actors !
Matthew McConaughey was amazing to watch. Just his acting alone brought me to tears multiple times. It all felt so real and it felt like he was genuinely in those moments. Just the little things made the acting feel so genuine and I just had to think about how he manages to do it.
I love little details. One of them I really liked was that they wouldn't use sound effects when the camera was in space. There's no sound in space and I think that's, maybe a small, but important thing to remember that just made it feel so much cooler.
Amazing movie, I love everything about it (besides the characters being a little stupid at times... but I guess you could say it's from the stress and they're not thinking clearly. But...).

Director Christopher Nolan has crafted a stunning epic that explores the vastness of space, the depths of the human psyche, and the power of love and sacrifice.
The film stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a former pilot and engineer who is called upon to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. Alongside an exceptional supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, McConaughey delivers a powerful performance that anchors the film with emotion and heart.
Interstellar is a visual marvel, with stunning cinematography that captures the majesty and awe of space travel. The film's sound design is also exceptional, immersing the viewer in the sounds of space and the silence of the void.
What sets Interstellar apart, however, is its storytelling. Nolan weaves a complex and thought-provoking narrative that touches on themes of time, destiny, and the nature of existence. The film is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant, leaving the viewer with a sense of wonder and awe at the universe and our place within it.
Overall, Interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Nolan has crafted a film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its exploration of the human condition. It is a must-see for anyone who loves science fiction, great storytelling, or simply a good film. Five stars, without question.","towerss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur164241189/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2023","10"

I have always liked how Nolan builds his movies. He has a gift. One only needs to remember Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and now Interstellar. There will always be a debate after a movie like Interstellar if this is the best one from Nolan ever or was it Inception. Personally I feel that Inception was pretty remarkable. It was not an easy concept and was rendered remarkably on the screen but then that was Inception and this review is not about it
Coming back to Interstellar- I was not able to see the movie as soon as it came out. A lot of people beat me to it and gave me rave reviews – ""must watch"", ""filmmaking at its best"", ""remarkable"" and so on. A significant number of them are not into science fiction at all and so all this galvanized me into action. Being wary of 'spoilers' I read as little about the movie as possible (online and print). Today I corrected that anomaly and find myself quite amused at the end of it all.
Interstellar is a very fascinating movie. I went to see the movie with my better half and though I enjoyed the ride she was lost halfway through the movie though she has a decent appreciation of science fiction genre. I found myself explaining some concepts to her after the movie but I realized that it had not worked for her the way it had for me.
The movie starts with a basic dooms day scenario but that is the only thing 'basic' about the movie. The special effects are decent and the physics (+metaphysics) in there is challenging to say the least and that is when I feel that I have a special taste/appetite for this kind of stuff. For example the movie contains concepts like wormhole/time dilation/black hole/extra dimensional beings and lots of metaphysics thrown in for a good measure. The movie uses the 'Gravity' as a catch all explanation and does a less than adequate job of explaining it for the uninitiated. Hence many viewers may view that as stretching of scientific concepts. This is not a movie that may endear itself in first go. Even those with a more than normal understanding of the concepts involved therein may have to read a bit more and then go in for a 2nd viewing to appreciate it more adequately.
This is where the most interesting part comes in- the hullabaloo about the movie. Majority of the people I know who are praising this movie to high heavens would find themselves sufficiently challenged if I was to ask them to state Newton's 3 laws of motion. I am reminded of something I read a long time ago – A Classic is a book that everyone talks about but nobody ever reads. At some point a certain view (right or wrong is important only in retrospect) about this movie was formed by the first- goers and I feel that has become the consensus view by adoption and not based on experience for many viewers.
This movie affords an opportunity to pull up our understanding of some remarkable concepts in Physics that may be unfamiliar territory for many. By blindly praising the movie and not making an effort to understand the physics behind it is, if I can dare say, an insult to those involved in the making of this movie.","bikram-duggal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19776250/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2014","7"

The film pushes through what he puts in place (like the main character): the dramatic stakes, metaphysical questions... And even if the reflection is not always accessible, it remains, through the film, an amazing and unique science of rhythm, which the director has the secret. A film highly cinematographic. If you are not a ""cinema professional"", go ahead also, you will find some beautiful and sensitive experiences during the screening of the film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Good mind-stretching movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3135840/?ref_=tt_urv","My daughter and I saw this together - we both like mind-stretching movies that don't always wrap everything up in a neat package. My wife stayed home because she is the opposite...she has to have a beginning, middle, and (happy) ending. When we got home and she asked ""what happened"" we just said somewhat lamely...""relativity happened"".
It wasn't quite up to the level of 2001, but then I am not sure anything ever will be. Not quite up to the same level of Inception in some ways but certainly equal or surpassing in others. This is a movie you can find inconsistencies in, but on the other hand our human understanding of relativity and all its ramifications is still nowhere near being up to the level of its discoverer, Einstein.
I think what impressed both of us was the intensity of this movie experience if you allowed yourself to ""willfully suspend disbelief"".
My daughter actually said it best at the end when she took a deep breath and said ""I don't know whether to laugh, cry, or scream right now.""
Now THAT is a movie!","mikealmond","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22726805/?ref_=tt_urv","4 December 2014","10"

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason. Please spare 3 hours and enjoy some of the best screen time your ever going to witness.","ummer-51499","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur108445078/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2020","10"

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

In conclusion, 169 minutes of masterpiece, you wont regret and you wont forget the experience watching this movie. Stop all your movie watch list or whatever, and just start watch this movie immedietly.","naufalkece","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114398312/?ref_=tt_urv","6 March 2020","10"

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

The insightful opinion on the mechanics of space-time and gravity (backed by the mental genius of Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Kip Thorne) is fascinating and mind-bending. For those uninterested in the phenomena of space, the beautiful storytelling at the base of this movie, such as the father-daughter relationship, or the feeling of ultimate betrayal will leave viewers leaving the theater exhilarated as disembark from the emotional rollercoaster this movie is. 10/10 for me and a job well done for all those involved in the making of this movie (and of course special thanks to Christopher Nolan's enthralling storytelling).","somnath796","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116617832/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2020","10"

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you. First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Advantage of this film is that it teaches people and gives them new information about universe. It's real-life movie, because we can face the same problems in the future. In my opinion ""Interstellar"", doesn't have cons.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","So the long","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775267/?ref_=tt_urv","So the long-awaited day has come when I will go to the cinema and appreciate the new work of a director who has become venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet... This is the main synopsis offered to us, but as always in the film we will see either more of what is in the trailer.","iezhov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551607/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

So, such films as ""Gravity"", the Batman trilogy, ""Avatar"" transfers the palm to Interstellar in terms of picture quality and staging.
I believe that in the near future it is unlikely that anyone will be able to achieve such a level of quality and grandiosity of special effects - it is unforgettable, it amazes, inspires.
It is impossible to describe into what world of pleasure this picture immerses the viewer.
""Interstellar"" is a three-hour unforgettable journey into an incredible beauty and scale of history. And I didn't regret a single minute spent watching this movie, it's worth it.","aromenskaya","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551860/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

If you forgot the school course, I want to note that you will not find anything about it in textbooks, do not forget that time as such was invented by us, another technique for measuring distances between celestial bodies, so such plot twists are a figment of fantasy no more, akin to a witch hunt in the Middle Ages. Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

Back in 2014, I went to the cinema for a film that became venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched him ""The Beginning"". He became one of my favorite directors of our time. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the corners of the filmed films, this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
In fact, this film tried to combine real scientific research about gravity, space-time and movement in it, Einstein's theory of relativity and show not only science fiction, but also a drama about the relationship of people on the verge of the Apocalypse.

This is awesome movie that challenges your understanding of space and exoplanets beyond our reach of the solar system. The vision affects team does an amazing job of illustrating what a black hole looks like and how time dilation affects the astronauts versus the time as which the people on earth are experiencing.

This is truly the best movie I have ever watched. EVER. Its so underrated, especially by people who just want Michael Bay-esque explosions with incoherent plots.
It's intelligent. You can tell that it was written by an intelligent person who got help from other intelligent people. The science is so sound even after 7 years and I have never had a single reason to criticise the movie or its production.
The soundtrack is epic. Every time I listen to it, I get goosebumps remembering certain scenes in the movie and the way they left me in the edge of my seat, especially the 'no time for caution' scene!
The characters and their mission are so believable and relatable. There are times when you feel like an explorer yourself and imagine what you'd do in certain situations; this being the hallmark of a truly immersive movie.
The plot was both complicated and very simple at the same time, allowing for enjoyment despite the level you watch it at (unlike tenet).
Its still a fantastic watch anyday, anytime. Especially with the terrible content Hollywood is churning these days, it's a little reassuring to know that great writers and directors still exist.
All in all, a resounding 10/10.","emad-28284","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156537261/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2022","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Fantastically beautiful, masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8530642/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is the most significant and remarkable film of recent years in the science fiction genre.
The plot contains various elements which allow the audiences to follow up, whether it is family drama, philosophical aspects and science technology. The scenarios are narrated upon actuality logic through creative imagination of the directors, the Nolan brothers. While the film is full of science fiction and slang about a black hole, the fifth dimension, the film was great in terms of how they portray the story easier and smoothly. I would say that instead of getting entangled in the wild twists and turns of astrophysics, you collect a handful of scientific knowledge at home without knowing it.
Apart from the plot, what should not be left out are the messages which engrave in the story. The intimate relationship between a single dad, Cooper and two of his children, Murph and Tom is pure and powerful. Cooper has to sacrifice basic human desires; home and love ones in hope not only to save millions of people but also find a promising future for his kids. It represents tender tale of love and loss. Matthew McConaughey's performance as a main actor is undeniably first class with voice trembling in the sentimental scenes. Anne Hathaway is also serving up well as a support actress, even though she is not the main one.
For visual and effects, Nolan used anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm cameras with a tall aspect ratio during the process while switching location from one country to another. Other than that, to reduce the use of computer graphic, he had practical locations built such as the interior of space shuttle.
Besides, the soundtracks of Interstellar were composed by Hans Zimmer which has previously worked with Nolan before. The genre of these soundtracks are cotemporary classic and also minimal but sentimental. He also used booming music in most of the scenes to build up excitement level of the audiences.
Interstellar brings together different kind of feelings; sadness, impressive and emotional feelings, but what thrilled me the most was realizing about the impact and power of love as it is beyond all reasons and rules in the universe. In my opinion, this film is worth giving a go, just because of movie is great and so realistic.","saule-27695","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156633140/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2022","10"

A group of astronauts go to space for Saturn to move the world into the saturn. And in the movie, he also explained his difference during his time in space.

The cinematography and special effects are stunning, making for a visually breathtaking experience.
One of the strengths of ""Interstellar"" is its attention to scientific accuracy, which is uncommon in most science fiction movies. The film is grounded in scientific concepts such as relativity and time dilation, which makes the story more believable and engaging. The film also explores deeper philosophical themes, such as the nature of human existence and the meaning of life.
However, some critics have pointed out that the film's plot can be convoluted and confusing at times, which may be a barrier to some viewers' enjoyment. Additionally, some of the scientific concepts and theories explored in the movie may be challenging for some viewers to understand.
Overall, ""Interstellar"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking film that tackles complex themes in a visually stunning and engaging way. While it may not be for everyone, it is definitely worth watching for fans of science fiction and those interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe.","katyakulyzhka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur162272700/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2023","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","A real masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8908145/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.
From the very first scene, Interstellar is an incredibly immersive and breathtaking cinematic experience. The film's stunning visuals, paired with Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score, create an otherworldly atmosphere that draws the viewer in and never lets go.
One of the most impressive aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of complex scientific concepts such as relativity, time dilation, and the theory of gravity. These ideas are woven seamlessly into the film's narrative, adding a layer of intellectual depth that is often missing in mainstream Hollywood films.
The film's cast is also exceptional. Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut who must grapple with the emotional toll of leaving his family behind in order to save humanity. Anne Hathaway is equally impressive as Dr. Brand, a brilliant scientist who must confront the harsh realities of space travel.
Perhaps the most emotionally resonant aspect of Interstellar is its examination of the relationships between the characters. The bond between Cooper and his daughter, Murph (played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain), is at the heart of the film's story, and their interactions are both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.
At its core, Interstellar is a film about humanity's place in the universe and the choices we must make in order to survive. The film's themes of sacrifice, love, and the power of human connection are explored with depth and nuance, making for a truly profound viewing experience.
Overall, I would give Interstellar 10 out of 10 stars. It is a masterpiece of science fiction filmmaking, and one that will stay with me for a long time. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself to be a visionary director, and the film's exceptional cast and technical achievements make it a must-see for anyone who loves cinema. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch - you won't be disappointed.","silviomalvestio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163000476/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2023","10"

The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics and special effects are beautiful, the music is so flipping good and emotional, and the ACTING, especially Cooper, is phenomenal.
Rarely does a movie make me feel as many emotions as this one did.
The music made me feel amazing, it made me feel scared as all living hell, it did so well at making you /feel/ and so did the actors !
Matthew McConaughey was amazing to watch. Just his acting alone brought me to tears multiple times. It all felt so real and it felt like he was genuinely in those moments. Just the little things made the acting feel so genuine and I just had to think about how he manages to do it.
I love little details. One of them I really liked was that they wouldn't use sound effects when the camera was in space. There's no sound in space and I think that's, maybe a small, but important thing to remember that just made it feel so much cooler.

Director Christopher Nolan has crafted a stunning epic that explores the vastness of space, the depths of the human psyche, and the power of love and sacrifice.
The film stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a former pilot and engineer who is called upon to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. Alongside an exceptional supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, McConaughey delivers a powerful performance that anchors the film with emotion and heart.
Interstellar is a visual marvel, with stunning cinematography that captures the majesty and awe of space travel. The film's sound design is also exceptional, immersing the viewer in the sounds of space and the silence of the void.
What sets Interstellar apart, however, is its storytelling. Nolan weaves a complex and thought-provoking narrative that touches on themes of time, destiny, and the nature of existence. The film is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant, leaving the viewer with a sense of wonder and awe at the universe and our place within it.
Overall, Interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Nolan has crafted a film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its exploration of the human condition. It is a must-see for anyone who loves science fiction, great storytelling, or simply a good film.

This film, which I also offer to you, tells a story full of excitement and drama along with brain and fascinating topics.
Directed by Christopher Nolan in Interstellar, he has used beautiful music and rich images to describe the story. In this film, a world is depicted in which everything is different and attractive. Following the amazing journey of this movie, you can enjoy its great pleasure.
In short, Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the best and most exciting drama and exciting films to be offered for any cinema interested. The best part of this film is not only its beautiful and attractive images, but also the deep concepts that are expressed will take you to another world.","mehrdroidtm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur165193348/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2023","10"

Space movies like this one all have one key ingredient, a good slice of pizza. Pizza during the launch was the best part of the movie.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Surprised that the studios went ahead and made this movie, but I'm glad they did...!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3124776/?ref_=tt_urv","Let me start by saying that this is a very fascinating movie and has the quintessential 'Christopher Nolan' stamp all over. I have always liked how Nolan builds his movies. He has a gift. One only needs to remember Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and now Interstellar. There will always be a debate after a movie like Interstellar if this is the best one from Nolan ever or was it Inception. Personally I feel that Inception was pretty remarkable. It was not an easy concept and was rendered remarkably on the screen but then that was Inception and this review is not about it
Coming back to Interstellar- I was not able to see the movie as soon as it came out. A lot of people beat me to it and gave me rave reviews – ""must watch"", ""filmmaking at its best"", ""remarkable"" and so on. A significant number of them are not into science fiction at all and so all this galvanized me into action. Being wary of 'spoilers' I read as little about the movie as possible (online and print). Today I corrected that anomaly and find myself quite amused at the end of it all.
Interstellar is a very fascinating movie. I went to see the movie with my better half and though I enjoyed the ride she was lost halfway through the movie though she has a decent appreciation of science fiction genre. I found myself explaining some concepts to her after the movie but I realized that it had not worked for her the way it had for me.
The movie starts with a basic dooms day scenario but that is the only thing 'basic' about the movie. The special effects are decent and the physics (+metaphysics) in there is challenging to say the least and that is when I feel that I have a special taste/appetite for this kind of stuff. For example the movie contains concepts like wormhole/time dilation/black hole/extra dimensional beings and lots of metaphysics thrown in for a good measure. The movie uses the 'Gravity' as a catch all explanation and does a less than adequate job of explaining it for the uninitiated. Hence many viewers may view that as stretching of scientific concepts. This is not a movie that may endear itself in first go. Even those with a more than normal understanding of the concepts involved therein may have to read a bit more and then go in for a 2nd viewing to appreciate it more adequately.
This is where the most interesting part comes in- the hullabaloo about the movie. Majority of the people I know who are praising this movie to high heavens would find themselves sufficiently challenged if I was to ask them to state Newton's 3 laws of motion. I am reminded of something I read a long time ago – A Classic is a book that everyone talks about but nobody ever reads. At some point a certain view (right or wrong is important only in retrospect) about this movie was formed by the first- goers and I feel that has become the consensus view by adoption and not based on experience for many viewers.
This movie affords an opportunity to pull up our understanding of some remarkable concepts in Physics that may be unfamiliar territory for many. By blindly praising the movie and not making an effort to understand the physics behind it is, if I can dare say, an insult to those involved in the making of this movie.","bikram-duggal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19776250/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2014","7"

It wasn't quite up to the level of 2001, but then I am not sure anything ever will be. Not quite up to the same level of Inception in some ways but certainly equal or surpassing in others. This is a movie you can find inconsistencies in, but on the other hand our human understanding of relativity and all its ramifications is still nowhere near being up to the level of its discoverer, Einstein.
I think what impressed both of us was the intensity of this movie experience if you allowed yourself to ""willfully suspend disbelief"".

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Brilliant visuals and concept but ultimately disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3120134/?ref_=tt_urv","The sense I really got from the film was that it tried to incorporate too many concepts and story lines into a single film and in the end failed.
The greatest flaws were
(1) A distinct problem with characterization. For example, Doyle was never even really introduced before his untimely death. His sole purpose was to fuel 'grief' and 'tension' between Conn and Brands – but it failed even at this. For many audiences, they probably never even remembered who Doyle was 5 minutes after his death. Soon after this, Nolan had the chance to redeem himself by showing the toll that 23 years of waiting had on Romilly. Instead, a many who has been in solitude for 23 years shows remarkable sanity. Days later he dies in an explosion that is not only unremarkable but denies the audience a chance of having any empathy for Romilly. Tom, Conns son, is never characterized properly in the first act. Subsequently Nolan attempts to incorporate him with a series of videos from home. It does allow the audience to relate to him somewhat, but this is squandered by a poor foundation. Later on, his relationship with Murph seems shallow and unintimate. He is not even mentioned by Conn when he returns from the tesserect, one begs to ask is Tom even Conns son. I would also say that Mann's character is completely unnecessary and serves little purpose. Nolan has undoubtedly placed Mann in an attempt to portray the thematic concern of humanity's ability for corruption and selfishness. Mann is the fallen knight, the expression of humanity's dark side. Yet the failure of Nolan to really push this thematic concern earlier on really makes Mann's role incongruent to the bigger picture in the movie. Finally Brands relationship with Conn is not realized in any meaningful way. She gives a speech on how Love transcends time – yet this seems contrived and artificial. What's more incongruent is her love with ""Edmonds"" who we never even see in person and who we can not empathize with in any manner. Furthermore one wonders why Conn chooses to go back to Brands at the ending of the movie; is it friendship or is it love? One surmises it is love; but this is not made clear at all.
2) Nolanfailed to understand Science fiction as a genre. Look at the classics which have really shaped science fiction as a genre. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. One of the keys to Kubrick's film was the black monolith whose role is only implied but never explained. This intrinsic mystery is a facet that is replayed again and again; thick paper cranes in Blade Runner. There was no real sense of mystery in interstellar.
Nolan was too technical in his film and attempted to pass fake science as real science. I agree that science fiction utilizes fake science; but almost all film makers either portray the science as completely (1) impossible e.g. Star trek or (2) Possible and believable e.g. Gravity and Gattaca. When you try to explain real science – do it properly or don't do it at all. The science of Interstellar would have been acceptable if Nolan had simply not gone to great lengths to explain it to the audience and make it seem real.
OVERALL impressions - quite disappointing from Nolan. Too many ideas and characters and not enough coherence to really make it a profound film.","SeventhChance","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23589122/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2014","7"

I'm not sure whether Nolan has been inspired by Zemekis's 'Contact' or not but this epic cosmic adventure is sure worth watching at this very late.
Set in the near future the production of crops have decreased at an alarming rate due to crop viruses n change in climates.Scientist have discovered a wormhole near Saturn & already set a team of explorers led by Dr Mann in search of potentially habitable planets.The experimental data they have send back is not enough but its certain that mankind's next destination is out there.
Meanwhile following the dust trace in the library former NASA's pilot Cooper & his only daughter Murphy enters into an restricted area of the current project of NASA.Cooper is also an engineer and now he is a farmer.Later on they introduce to Professor John who is the pioneer of this project.Coop agrees with professor John to go on a new mission along with some crews leaving his daughter Murph,his son & his father behind here on earth for furthermore evident data & of course finding out mankind's new home.. You know in the realm of Quantum mechanics & Relativity ..strangest things happen.Time get stuck in event horizon..traveling through wormhole/near the speed of light cause a diverse effect on time in comparison of our normal time.Can Cooper n his team come back on earth in time n save the human race from extinction¿ Can Coop keep the promise he gave to his daughter¿ The first half of the movie is a bit slower than second half.The last half is a hell-ride!!
Jessica Chastain & Matthew Mcconaughey have delivered a solid n heart warming performance.
The thing that pinch me a bit is that wormhole doesn't last that long interval of time(as far as m concerned). Since its a science fiction film expecting everything accurate is not wish enough so m was OK after a while.Except this some other facts like time dilation,event horizon,gravitational field,black hole,space-time singularity is pretty perfect.As theoretical physicist Kip Thorne has worked on this film,things have turn out this much perfect.
Moreover Hans Zimmer's score & Van Hotema's cinematography makes the film more appealing n beautiful.Written by two bros Jonathan n Christopher Nolan, Dir by Ch. Nolan its the best space-time thrill I have ever encountered since after Contact.","saffatflintlockwood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24425563/?ref_=tt_urv","9 September 2016","9"

I'm not one of those fanatic Nolan fans who love anything he may throw at them, and I am one of the very few who felt Inception was ridiculous. And yet, Interstellar is one of the best movies I have ever watched.
In the near future, a blight that survives on nitrogen starts destroying all the crops and our Earth is no more an inhabitable planet. Humans have no choice but to look to the stars for other places for survival. Our hero, who is a former pilot and now a farmer, sets out on this quest with a team of astronauts, leaving behind his family.
The Bad: The first half doesn't feel like a Nolan movie. The panache that appears in his other works, especially the sense of seriousness and hurry, is surprisingly missing. There are long conversations without any background music, that makes you wonder why music composer, Hans Zimmer, who usually goes for the fast beats, has toned down the music so drastically. Parts of the movie feel maudlin, with arguments like ""love is the one thing that transcends space and time"", but the script makes sure that there is someone to counter such arguments with more rational ones, even if the movie doesn't agree with them. The one problem that always existed in Nolan's scripts continues to fester here: characters explaining the plot and the rules to each other, in order to let audience know, even if its obvious that they shouldn't need to explain it to each other. Since this is a movie with esoteric physics concepts at its core, there is a lot of mutual explanation between scientists that doesn't make much sense.
The Good: It does not suffer from one of the biggest problems I feared it would: logical errors. Even though it may seem a little far-fetched, the logic seems sound. Einstein's theories of relativity are extensively exploited, and at times these concepts even elicit emotional responses. The movie also ventures into more opaque fields of theoretical physics, which pique your curiosity to learn more after watching the movie. There are moments such as the spacecraft leaving earth where the music and direction couldn't have been any better. The second half is as gripping as it gets, with scenes interleaving between different spaces and timelines, with numerous challenging but well-crafted scenes, stunning visuals, riveting music, and a couple breathtaking revelations. The robot TARS, with its bare minimum appearance, adds just the right amount of levity to several moments of otherwise monotonous dialogues in the first half. This is one of those movies where every aspect of the film has to be crafted perfectly and put together beautifully in order for it to work and Nolan is just the man for the job. From Hans Zimmer's music to Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography to Matthew McConaughey's acting, there is a perfect conflation of skills to make the movie what it is.
Although people do a lot of nitpicking when it comes to Nolan's movies, the plot of this movie, is scientifically possible, even though highly improbable, and the logic is irreproachable. I've had to ponder for a while to make sense of it all but that's what makes the movie so great, that it leaves you thinking about it long after its over. I will give it a 9 on 10. Must watch.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar - Nearly Stellar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3121498/?ref_=tt_urv","If there is one thing that needs to be said about Interstellar it is thisTiny but Massive. There is simply no question that Interstellar is a hugely ambitious film, and similarly there is no question that it is at once an awe inspiring adventure that is epic whilst at the same time remaining poignantly personal. There is also very little question that, a little bit like the wormholes that are described in its plot, on occasions it folds in on itself causing it to fall strangely flat.
Although not a perfect movie and slightly baggy in parts it has to be admired for its sheer scope and vision. Although certain sections make little to no sense (I'm looking at you, the final 20 minutes) and although the film feels too determined at points to resolve everything it has lain out, you will forgive it these minor shortcomings (and they are minor in the grand scheme of the picture) due to its 100 % commitment to the story and the films overall class. It is, despite many critical quibbles, very well scripted for a sci-fi movie, insanely well-paced despite its near 3 hour running time and disgracefully beautiful to watch. The films score is, if a little biblical at times and therefore worldly, pretty sexy too.
Matthew McConaughey puts in a very decent performance considering the sheer scope of his role and the supporting cast is pretty impressive too, although I do feel that Michael Caine's consistent turn in Nolan movies breaks the wall slightly. Thematically the film is about life, recreation and relationships and I felt for a film with no traditional style 'love' interests the visual reinforcement of sex and togetherness in the way that the a lot of the machinery works on the spacecraft (struggling to insert and connect) was nothing short of spectacular. It is here where the film is at its strongest – visually. The simplicity of certain sections are somewhat ruined by the over complicated ending that, when broken down is frustrating and amounts to very little.
All in all however it is films like this that the cinema was made for and although it will naturally be compared to other Nolan films and of course, 2001 & last years Gravity, it is on its own terms that Interstellar works best. These terms are simpleout of this world.","onebigmob1845","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26018350/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2014","8"

Is a film that makes you think and reflect, also teaches us something of physics. I felt that I was surprised at every moment, things happen unexpected. The special effects are very good, for something he won a Oscar. A great cast, great performances.

Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason.

And what a heck of a writer he is and his brother. Each and Every time I watched the film I got connected with Copper, with Brand, Rom, CASE, Tars and even with Dr. Maann. I can sense my present on that greatest voyage of mankind. I think that's what Interstellar to me actually. The love was the main bindings, the path to rise and shine in the whole movie. The best ever last 10 minutes of my life appears each and every time I watched Interstellar. What a finest actor Matthew McConaughey is! No one can replace him ever in such kind of movie, the greatest love he portrayed for her daughter. What a piece of art the whole movie was!
I'm not a science fiction buff. But I've to admit no other movie could be comparable to Interstellar. This movie is 'my ghost' as well. What an incredible presence of the most difficult astrophysical term.
And the masterpiece of Nolan about ""Time'' as it's decorated with ""Love"" unparalleled.
Interstellar is an obsession of mine will be forever I know.

This movie starts out so simple. We see a father and his family living, and surviving, on a farm in Midwest America. It builds the characters from the ground up. It lays down the entire plot from the get-go, but the viewer does not even realize it until the end. What comes across as a sci-fi or fantasy film so perfectly intertwines the illusion of interstellar travel with the reality of human connection. The emotion this film captures is so much stronger than any scientific theory that exists. It is a long film, almost 3 hours. However, every second is necessary. The beginning brings the common viewer in with the relationship of a family trying to survive, not for themselves, but for each other. The middle presents us with so many beautiful depictions of space and time, and all the concepts that exist beyond current human understanding. And the end. The end brings together both themes. That we are all here to save each other, to save the ones we love. That is the beauty of this film.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: an Astronomical Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428215/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.
Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.
The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.
Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.
Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece.","d-41769","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112732148/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2020","9"

Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling.
It is a movie worth watching and deserves more rating. You should watch it, promise you won't regret it!.","ivantur-92667","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur113261001/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2023","10"

Nolans ambition and talent, coupled with arguably the best leading performance he's ever had in McConaughey's Cooper, brings about a wonderful work of science fiction, one that leaves the viewer breathless during and talking after.

The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution' which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also. This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.

It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you. First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made. Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head. In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses.","jleall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117472039/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2020","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6098946/?ref_=tt_urv","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.","erafatema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124214226/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2020","8"

Without giving too much away if you're really into SCI-FI this is the film for you!

No such space movie has ever been taken in this way. The wormhole transports not only the cast but also your mind to a whole new level. I dont want to be a spoiler but I assure you that you will get goosebumps after their trip to the first planet. It is a MUST WATCH.

Interstellar fascinated me from the first time I saw it. And many more have followed.
The theory of how love is the most powerful force in the universe, and how they try to give a scientific explanation based on astrophysics and gravity, I find fascinating. Apart from that, the narrative and editing is impressive. How they play with time, with rhythm, I find it wonderful. Visual poetry is present throughout every scene, along with a beautiful soundtrack.
It seems to me a complete movie, adventure, thriller, mystery, science fiction, discovery, psychology, and above all LOVE.","guillembarcelo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127901212/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","10"

Advantage of this film is that it teaches people and gives them new information about universe. It's real-life movie, because we can face the same problems in the future. In my opinion ""Interstellar"", doesn't have cons.

Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched his ""The Beginning"" and against the background of the success of this film, I appreciated his ""Prestige"" and he became one of my favorite directors of our time. The creators have been working on this film for quite a long time, and initially director Steven Spielberg was assigned to the project, who began the production of this picture. Nolan appeared only in 2013 and immediately sprinkled ideas and in the end we get what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
The plot revolves around an ecological catastrophe (drought), which led to a food crisis for all of humanity, and in general, Mother nature, with every act of depletion of its resources, loses the ability to provide Humanity with everything it needs for existence. And a group of scientists goes to the Wormhole (the curvature of space and time) to relocate humanity to another planet... This is the main synopsis offered to us, but as always in the film we will see either more of what is in the trailer.","iezhov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148551607/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

It is impossible to describe into what world of pleasure this picture immerses the viewer.

Before starting a conversation about Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan, it is necessary to agree that this film was originally built in such a way that it would be talked about, argued about, reviewed and continued to argue about it again and again. This is a debatable creation of an outstanding master and indisputable talent. A picture that everyone will perceive differently: someone from the side of religion, someone from the side of science, someone from the side of the soul. And to find out who is right and who is not is completely pointless, because ""Interstellar"" is a timeless and extra-spatial film. Now, having agreed on this, let's discuss how it will be possible to do this without spoilers.
The plot introduces us to the Earth of the future, covered with dust and corn fields. Food is running out and the human race is in danger of extinction. A skilled pilot and father of two children is offered to lead a mission based on the real scientific work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, according to which Black holes are space-time tunnels leading to other galaxies and, accordingly, other worlds, one of which may be suitable for human life. . And then, to paraphrase a phrase from The Dark Knight, ""Nolan just doesn't happen.""
Interstellar is first and foremost an experience. Of those for which the cinema was originally created. Therefore, it is important to watch it on the biggest screen you can get. The film makes exactly the same impression as the train of the Lumiere brothers should once have on the audience of the Grand Café in Paris. Indescribable in words, pressing into the back of the chair, turning inside out all the insides. An absolutely incredible image in its beauty and immensity, amazing sound, magical music by Hans Zimmer, electrifying acting work. Everything here is done at a very special outstanding level.
The Nolan brothers' script covers so much at once that it's impossible to comprehend it in one sitting. Scientific theories and the fundamental laws of physics, emotionally touching to tears, warm lightening humor, philosophical questions and sayings, faith and an extraordinary sense of something fabulous are just around the corner. ""Interstellar"" is literally bursting with everything that the creators have put into it. It operates on a million different levels, blending an intriguing, compelling storyline built on ever-increasing stakes with deep, never-ending questions. Therefore, in the end, all this falls on you in a giant wave, literally sweeping you off your feet, enveloping you in hundreds of bubbles of various impulses, thoughts, ideas. The feeling when the movie ends is breathtaking. Wiping tears from your cheeks, you try in vain to realize where you are. It's like your mind has just been sent literally into space and they forgot to tell you how to return from the clouds to the earth.
As for Matthew McConaughey, he continues to show his seemingly limitless talents. With him, you want to go deeper into space, he brings so much soul and feelings to the screen. It is worth going even further and stating that this is his best role in his entire career. Although not only he, but also Anne Hathaway, who gave out a poignant performance, quite unexpectedly surpassed herself from the musical Les Misérables. Jessica Chastain very organically combines the coolness of character with the vulnerability of feelings. Here, Casey Affleck absolutely does not stand out, but Michael Caine is still a very familiar, rich in experience and hardening excellent Michael Caine. And Nolan has prepared a very big unexpected surprise, which will undoubtedly pleasantly surprise everyone.
If you still try to define ""Interstellar"" in some genre, then it will be not only an outstanding fantasy, but also an extremely tense thriller. Not only because of the many very action-packed moments, but also because of how masterfully they are filmed. Hoyte Van Hoytem should make a deep bow. Often the IMAX camera plays the role of a sort of GoPro, hung over the side of the spacecraft or attached to the actors' spacesuits. The resulting footage is beyond words, so they are both realistic and fantastic. Justified and full-scale complex and expensive shooting. The landscapes of the places where Nolan sends the audience along with the main characters are cosmically beautiful. It is almost impossible to believe that they found something similar on planet Earth. And quite successfully, hypnotically charming visual effects flow into the overall picture. There are moments in the film that will take your breath away without any 3D and other modern techniques. Gravity, with all of its Oscar-winning graphics, remains a mere memory stain compared to the all-encompassing grandiosity of Interstellar, not to mention the latter's millions of times more compelling plot.
Speaking about the plot, however, it is worth noting or even warning that the third act of the film is something magically contradictory, incomprehensible and mysterious. This is something that undoubtedly went to the head of critics who wrote negative reviews. And this is exactly the same discussion part, even more reminiscent of such films as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by Steven Spielberg and even ""Inception"" by Nolan himself. This is a very relative philosophical dive into depths that many will simply be reluctant or afraid to explore, while others will be frustrated by the ultimate understatement and obscurity. However, going back to the very beginning, this is how the film was intentionally constructed. No answers, no clear positions, no limits to further imagination. And if you think about it, there is nothing beyond fantasy there. It's just something that has not yet been presented to the judgment of moviegoers. Something new, exciting, giving that feeling of the unknown, which is exactly what ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is full of. That is why this Nolan film will be called delusional by some, but brilliant by many.
Interstellar is a movie that you can talk about indefinitely, because it was created for this. It still needs to be comprehended for a long time after leaving the hall, for a long time to diligently try to calm the trembling, for a long time to at least somehow suppress the delight from what he saw. This is another intellectual blockbuster, so many of which Christopher Nolan gave to the world or just a chic fantasy film. Everyone will like at least one of the many advantages that he has. This is a revolutionary cinema that remains in history and memory, imperceptibly permanent and irreconcilably controversial. The way a masterpiece should be.","ditovmasan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148555854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","7"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","An event that cannot be missed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7776866/?ref_=tt_urv","'Interstellar' is a fantastic film shot on a scale worthy of 'Star Wars', with a level of special effects superior to 'Avatar', possessing the realism of 'Gravity' and a denouement whose epicness can only be compared with Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'. Paintings of this level are extremely rare. Because it's not just fiction and not just expensive entertainment - it's a whole concept of the universe. This is an event that will not leave anyone indifferent, because when you leave the cinema, you can't think of anything else but these 2 hours and 49 minutes of the purest perfection. 2 hours 49 minutes of emotions, excitement, fear, laughter and happiness. 2 hours 49 minutes, which risks becoming one of the brightest moments in the life of every movie lover.
I usually try to find a reasonable explanation for the emotions that visit me during and after watching the movie. But this time it's quite difficult for me to do it. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a movie. I really appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan, I really respect Matthew McConaughey, I dote on the music of Hans Zimmer... But I didn't expect that these people could make such a big, so literate, so expressive and perfect in all respects film. So, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Interstellar, although absolutely everything is worthy of admiration here.
1. The plot. The action on the screen literally chained to the chair. The film does not stop for a second, keeping the audience in suspense until the very denouement. And, despite the impressive timing, there is nothing superfluous in the film: there are no intermediate events like preparation for flight or empty melodramatic scenes. The film has a place for humor and thoughtful discussions about life, which do not look moralizing at all and do not annoy. The film poses a lot of questions to the viewer and answers most of these questions. Moreover, these answers are mostly scientific in nature and are not based solely on the imagination of screenwriters.
2. Directing. To be able to shoot such a huge, million-part film and never lose your way without losing a drop of enthusiasm and common sense is an achievement subject only to a wise, I'm not afraid of this word, a great director. Create a movie starting with the views of the notorious cornfields and ending... something indescribably impressive, could only Christopher Nolan - a director from God, a man whose ability to work and love of cinema cannot but admire. And he is not an Oscar winner, but now he has a much more significant title. The title of 'The Person who created Interstellar'. Bravo, Nolan! Although we are not personally acquainted, but know that you are a genius.
3. Special Effects. I do not know how you can create a whole world, a whole galaxy (and more than one!) on the screen. In my opinion, this is beyond human capabilities. At the same time, the cosmos in this film looks not only beautiful, but also as realistic as possible. This is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes. There has never been such a space before in the entire history of science fiction films.
4. Music. Hans Zimmer surpasses himself and creates his best soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best musical accompaniments that have ever been heard in fiction. The music here is so beautiful and expressive that it simply cannot leave the viewer indifferent. This is really a very difficult and painstaking work of the composer and the whole orchestra, who created a work of art within a work of art.
5. Acting works. Without spoilers, it is not possible to describe a single character of this film. And do you know what it says? This suggests that each character has been worked out so thoroughly that it is interesting for the viewer to follow each of the characters without exception, because the fate of each of them is absolutely unpredictable. Acting works look just great. The duet of a man and a woman, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is simply brilliant. The complex psychological secondary images created by Jessica Chastain (who may well receive her third Oscar nomination for this role), Michael Caine (without whom no Nolan project is conceivable anymore) and Matt Damon (about whom I will not say a word on purpose) are simply beautiful.
Maybe Interstellar won't get an Oscar in the main category. Maybe he will not be recognized as the best by the leading critics of the planet (some of whom, for some unknown reason, write negative reviews). But it will be the movie of the year one way or another. The most discussed, the most popular, ambiguous, resonant, iconic and the most beloved among us viewers. Interstellar is a world-class event that cannot be missed.
Was it worth waiting for Interstellar for a whole year? Definitely worth it.
Did he live up to expectations? No, he did not justify it. He surpassed them.
Should I watch Interstellar? Hm... And you still ask? Whistle everyone to the cinemas, urgently!","berdyaev-94033","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148556414/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Cosmo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7775650/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher Nolan is the best director of our time, in my opinion. And it's not even that all his films are great, but that his every new movie turns out to be much better than the previous one, surprises and amazes to the core. At the same time, Nolan manages not to repeat himself, even when it comes to the third Batman movie. However, as it usually happens, always before watching the maestro's next picture, doubt creeps into the soul - and suddenly, this time Nolan will not succeed... Maybe someday it will be. But not now, not in the case of Interstellar.
This film is like a breath of fresh air, as a kind of reminder of how frankly second-rate movies have been ""fed"" to us lately. ""Interstellar"", being in the genre of science fiction about the conquest of space, causes so many different emotions that a dozen other films are not able to cause ... Nolan talks about love, about the fragility of life, about other dimensions, demonstrates human meanness and cowardice, makes you think and worry... After the film there is a very pleasant aftertaste - you definitely want to revise it in order to catch all the nuances and hints in order to understand it one hundred percent...
Separately, I would like to mention the music of Hans Zimmer. Nowadays, it is difficult to surprise with a cool soundtrack - it is already taken for granted. However, it is in Interstellar that the music in the background feels completely different from in other films - the fact is that it perfectly reflects my own emotions and feelings related to what is happening on the screen. I've never seen anything like this in a movie before...
""Interstellar"" is the best science fiction in the world, the best film of 2014 and one of the main creations of Christopher Nolan. Everyone should watch it, at least in order to make sure that in our time of endless comic book adaptations there are still people who know how to make a really brilliant movie.","matveisyhoi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148557288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2022","10"

Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

Back in 2014, I went to the cinema for a film that became venerable literally in an instant. Christopher Nolan became a discovery for me in 2010, when I watched him ""The Beginning"". He became one of my favorite directors of our time. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the corners of the filmed films, this film has a director's version, because the creators clearly wanted to say more than fit, but what fit was more than enough. Such films always have dangerous moments, such as the fact that not every topic gets a decent disclosure, but it seems to me that in this film everything turned out quite completely and every topic gets developed.
In fact, this film tried to combine real scientific research about gravity, space-time and movement in it, Einstein's theory of relativity and show not only science fiction, but also a drama about the relationship of people on the verge of the Apocalypse.

Discovering new things with the scenes in the movie will force your imagination and make you say ""what a movie it was"" after the movie ends.

This is truly the best movie I have ever watched. EVER. Its so underrated, especially by people who just want Michael Bay-esque explosions with incoherent plots.
It's intelligent. You can tell that it was written by an intelligent person who got help from other intelligent people. The science is so sound even after 7 years and I have never had a single reason to criticise the movie or its production.
The soundtrack is epic. Every time I listen to it, I get goosebumps remembering certain scenes in the movie and the way they left me in the edge of my seat, especially the 'no time for caution' scene!
The characters and their mission are so believable and relatable. There are times when you feel like an explorer yourself and imagine what you'd do in certain situations; this being the hallmark of a truly immersive movie.
The plot was both complicated and very simple at the same time, allowing for enjoyment despite the level you watch it at (unlike tenet).
Its still a fantastic watch anyday, anytime. Especially with the terrible content Hollywood is churning these days, it's a little reassuring to know that great writers and directors still exist.
All in all, a resounding 10/10.","emad-28284","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156537261/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2022","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Fantastically beautiful, masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8530642/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is the most significant and remarkable film of recent years in the science fiction genre.
The plot contains various elements which allow the audiences to follow up, whether it is family drama, philosophical aspects and science technology. The scenarios are narrated upon actuality logic through creative imagination of the directors, the Nolan brothers. While the film is full of science fiction and slang about a black hole, the fifth dimension, the film was great in terms of how they portray the story easier and smoothly. I would say that instead of getting entangled in the wild twists and turns of astrophysics, you collect a handful of scientific knowledge at home without knowing it.
Apart from the plot, what should not be left out are the messages which engrave in the story. The intimate relationship between a single dad, Cooper and two of his children, Murph and Tom is pure and powerful. Cooper has to sacrifice basic human desires; home and love ones in hope not only to save millions of people but also find a promising future for his kids. It represents tender tale of love and loss. Matthew McConaughey's performance as a main actor is undeniably first class with voice trembling in the sentimental scenes. Anne Hathaway is also serving up well as a support actress, even though she is not the main one.
For visual and effects, Nolan used anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm cameras with a tall aspect ratio during the process while switching location from one country to another. Other than that, to reduce the use of computer graphic, he had practical locations built such as the interior of space shuttle.
Besides, the soundtracks of Interstellar were composed by Hans Zimmer which has previously worked with Nolan before. The genre of these soundtracks are cotemporary classic and also minimal but sentimental. He also used booming music in most of the scenes to build up excitement level of the audiences.
Interstellar brings together different kind of feelings; sadness, impressive and emotional feelings, but what thrilled me the most was realizing about the impact and power of love as it is beyond all reasons and rules in the universe. In my opinion, this film is worth giving a go, just because of movie is great and so realistic.","saule-27695","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156633140/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2022","10"

The cinematography and special effects are stunning, making for a visually breathtaking experience.
One of the strengths of ""Interstellar"" is its attention to scientific accuracy, which is uncommon in most science fiction movies. The film is grounded in scientific concepts such as relativity and time dilation, which makes the story more believable and engaging. The film also explores deeper philosophical themes, such as the nature of human existence and the meaning of life.
However, some critics have pointed out that the film's plot can be convoluted and confusing at times, which may be a barrier to some viewers' enjoyment. Additionally, some of the scientific concepts and theories explored in the movie may be challenging for some viewers to understand.
Overall, ""Interstellar"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking film that tackles complex themes in a visually stunning and engaging way. While it may not be for everyone, it is definitely worth watching for fans of science fiction and those interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe.","katyakulyzhka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur162272700/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2023","10"
"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","A real masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8908145/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.
From the very first scene, Interstellar is an incredibly immersive and breathtaking cinematic experience. The film's stunning visuals, paired with Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score, create an otherworldly atmosphere that draws the viewer in and never lets go.
One of the most impressive aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of complex scientific concepts such as relativity, time dilation, and the theory of gravity. These ideas are woven seamlessly into the film's narrative, adding a layer of intellectual depth that is often missing in mainstream Hollywood films.
The film's cast is also exceptional. Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut who must grapple with the emotional toll of leaving his family behind in order to save humanity. Anne Hathaway is equally impressive as Dr. Brand, a brilliant scientist who must confront the harsh realities of space travel.
Perhaps the most emotionally resonant aspect of Interstellar is its examination of the relationships between the characters. The bond between Cooper and his daughter, Murph (played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain), is at the heart of the film's story, and their interactions are both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.
At its core, Interstellar is a film about humanity's place in the universe and the choices we must make in order to survive. The film's themes of sacrifice, love, and the power of human connection are explored with depth and nuance, making for a truly profound viewing experience.
Overall, I would give Interstellar 10 out of 10 stars. It is a masterpiece of science fiction filmmaking, and one that will stay with me for a long time. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself to be a visionary director, and the film's exceptional cast and technical achievements make it a must-see for anyone who loves cinema. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch - you won't be disappointed.","silviomalvestio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163000476/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2023","10"

The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics and special effects are beautiful, the music is so flipping good and emotional, and the ACTING, especially Cooper, is phenomenal.
Rarely does a movie make me feel as many emotions as this one did.
The music made me feel amazing, it made me feel scared as all living hell, it did so well at making you /feel/ and so did the actors !
Matthew McConaughey was amazing to watch. Just his acting alone brought me to tears multiple times. It all felt so real and it felt like he was genuinely in those moments. Just the little things made the acting feel so genuine and I just had to think about how he manages to do it.
I love little details. One of them I really liked was that they wouldn't use sound effects when the camera was in space. There's no sound in space and I think that's, maybe a small, but important thing to remember that just made it feel so much cooler.
Amazing movie, I love everything about it (besides the characters being a little stupid at times... but I guess you could say it's from the stress and they're not thinking clearly. But...).

Alongside an exceptional supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, McConaughey delivers a powerful performance that anchors the film with emotion and heart.
Interstellar is a visual marvel, with stunning cinematography that captures the majesty and awe of space travel. The film's sound design is also exceptional, immersing the viewer in the sounds of space and the silence of the void.
What sets Interstellar apart, however, is its storytelling. Nolan weaves a complex and thought-provoking narrative that touches on themes of time, destiny, and the nature of existence. The film is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant, leaving the viewer with a sense of wonder and awe at the universe and our place within it.
Overall, Interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Nolan has crafted a film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its exploration of the human condition. It is a must-see for anyone who loves science fiction, great storytelling, or simply a good film. Five stars, without question.","towerss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur164241189/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2023","10"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Surprised that the studios went ahead and made this movie, but I'm glad they did...!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3124776/?ref_=tt_urv","Let me start by saying that this is a very fascinating movie and has the quintessential 'Christopher Nolan' stamp all over. I have always liked how Nolan builds his movies. He has a gift. One only needs to remember Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and now Interstellar. There will always be a debate after a movie like Interstellar if this is the best one from Nolan ever or was it Inception. Personally I feel that Inception was pretty remarkable. It was not an easy concept and was rendered remarkably on the screen but then that was Inception and this review is not about it
Coming back to Interstellar- I was not able to see the movie as soon as it came out. A lot of people beat me to it and gave me rave reviews – ""must watch"", ""filmmaking at its best"", ""remarkable"" and so on. A significant number of them are not into science fiction at all and so all this galvanized me into action. Being wary of 'spoilers' I read as little about the movie as possible (online and print). Today I corrected that anomaly and find myself quite amused at the end of it all.
Interstellar is a very fascinating movie. I went to see the movie with my better half and though I enjoyed the ride she was lost halfway through the movie though she has a decent appreciation of science fiction genre. I found myself explaining some concepts to her after the movie but I realized that it had not worked for her the way it had for me.
The movie starts with a basic dooms day scenario but that is the only thing 'basic' about the movie. The special effects are decent and the physics (+metaphysics) in there is challenging to say the least and that is when I feel that I have a special taste/appetite for this kind of stuff. For example the movie contains concepts like wormhole/time dilation/black hole/extra dimensional beings and lots of metaphysics thrown in for a good measure. The movie uses the 'Gravity' as a catch all explanation and does a less than adequate job of explaining it for the uninitiated. Hence many viewers may view that as stretching of scientific concepts. This is not a movie that may endear itself in first go. Even those with a more than normal understanding of the concepts involved therein may have to read a bit more and then go in for a 2nd viewing to appreciate it more adequately.
This is where the most interesting part comes in- the hullabaloo about the movie. Majority of the people I know who are praising this movie to high heavens would find themselves sufficiently challenged if I was to ask them to state Newton's 3 laws of motion. I am reminded of something I read a long time ago – A Classic is a book that everyone talks about but nobody ever reads. At some point a certain view (right or wrong is important only in retrospect) about this movie was formed by the first- goers and I feel that has become the consensus view by adoption and not based on experience for many viewers.
This movie affords an opportunity to pull up our understanding of some remarkable concepts in Physics that may be unfamiliar territory for many. By blindly praising the movie and not making an effort to understand the physics behind it is, if I can dare say, an insult to those involved in the making of this movie.","bikram-duggal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19776250/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2014","7"

It wasn't quite up to the level of 2001, but then I am not sure anything ever will be. Not quite up to the same level of Inception in some ways but certainly equal or surpassing in others. This is a movie you can find inconsistencies in, but on the other hand our human understanding of relativity and all its ramifications is still nowhere near being up to the level of its discoverer, Einstein.
I think what impressed both of us was the intensity of this movie experience if you allowed yourself to ""willfully suspend disbelief"".

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Brilliant visuals and concept but ultimately disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3120134/?ref_=tt_urv","The sense I really got from the film was that it tried to incorporate too many concepts and story lines into a single film and in the end failed.
The greatest flaws were
(1) A distinct problem with characterization. For example, Doyle was never even really introduced before his untimely death. His sole purpose was to fuel 'grief' and 'tension' between Conn and Brands – but it failed even at this. For many audiences, they probably never even remembered who Doyle was 5 minutes after his death. Soon after this, Nolan had the chance to redeem himself by showing the toll that 23 years of waiting had on Romilly. Instead, a many who has been in solitude for 23 years shows remarkable sanity. Days later he dies in an explosion that is not only unremarkable but denies the audience a chance of having any empathy for Romilly. Tom, Conns son, is never characterized properly in the first act. Subsequently Nolan attempts to incorporate him with a series of videos from home. It does allow the audience to relate to him somewhat, but this is squandered by a poor foundation. Later on, his relationship with Murph seems shallow and unintimate. He is not even mentioned by Conn when he returns from the tesserect, one begs to ask is Tom even Conns son. I would also say that Mann's character is completely unnecessary and serves little purpose. Nolan has undoubtedly placed Mann in an attempt to portray the thematic concern of humanity's ability for corruption and selfishness. Mann is the fallen knight, the expression of humanity's dark side. Yet the failure of Nolan to really push this thematic concern earlier on really makes Mann's role incongruent to the bigger picture in the movie. Finally Brands relationship with Conn is not realized in any meaningful way. She gives a speech on how Love transcends time – yet this seems contrived and artificial. What's more incongruent is her love with ""Edmonds"" who we never even see in person and who we can not empathize with in any manner. Furthermore one wonders why Conn chooses to go back to Brands at the ending of the movie; is it friendship or is it love? One surmises it is love; but this is not made clear at all.
2) Nolanfailed to understand Science fiction as a genre. Look at the classics which have really shaped science fiction as a genre. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. One of the keys to Kubrick's film was the black monolith whose role is only implied but never explained. This intrinsic mystery is a facet that is replayed again and again; thick paper cranes in Blade Runner. There was no real sense of mystery in interstellar.
Nolan was too technical in his film and attempted to pass fake science as real science. I agree that science fiction utilizes fake science; but almost all film makers either portray the science as completely (1) impossible e.g. Star trek or (2) Possible and believable e.g. Gravity and Gattaca. When you try to explain real science – do it properly or don't do it at all. The science of Interstellar would have been acceptable if Nolan had simply not gone to great lengths to explain it to the audience and make it seem real.
OVERALL impressions - quite disappointing from Nolan. Too many ideas and characters and not enough coherence to really make it a profound film.","SeventhChance","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23589122/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2014","7"

I'm not sure whether Nolan has been inspired by Zemekis's 'Contact' or not but this epic cosmic adventure is sure worth watching at this very late.
Set in the near future the production of crops have decreased at an alarming rate due to crop viruses n change in climates.Scientist have discovered a wormhole near Saturn & already set a team of explorers led by Dr Mann in search of potentially habitable planets.The experimental data they have send back is not enough but its certain that mankind's next destination is out there.
Meanwhile following the dust trace in the library former NASA's pilot Cooper & his only daughter Murphy enters into an restricted area of the current project of NASA.Cooper is also an engineer and now he is a farmer.Later on they introduce to Professor John who is the pioneer of this project.Coop agrees with professor John to go on a new mission along with some crews leaving his daughter Murph,his son & his father behind here on earth for furthermore evident data & of course finding out mankind's new home.. You know in the realm of Quantum mechanics & Relativity ..strangest things happen.Time get stuck in event horizon..traveling through wormhole/near the speed of light cause a diverse effect on time in comparison of our normal time.Can Cooper n his team come back on earth in time n save the human race from extinction¿ Can Coop keep the promise he gave to his daughter¿ The first half of the movie is a bit slower than second half.The last half is a hell-ride!!
Jessica Chastain & Matthew Mcconaughey have delivered a solid n heart warming performance.
The thing that pinch me a bit is that wormhole doesn't last that long interval of time(as far as m concerned). Since its a science fiction film expecting everything accurate is not wish enough so m was OK after a while.Except this some other facts like time dilation,event horizon,gravitational field,black hole,space-time singularity is pretty perfect.As theoretical physicist Kip Thorne has worked on this film,things have turn out this much perfect.
Moreover Hans Zimmer's score & Van Hotema's cinematography makes the film more appealing n beautiful.Written by two bros Jonathan n Christopher Nolan, Dir by Ch.

I'm not one of those fanatic Nolan fans who love anything he may throw at them, and I am one of the very few who felt Inception was ridiculous. And yet, Interstellar is one of the best movies I have ever watched.
In the near future, a blight that survives on nitrogen starts destroying all the crops and our Earth is no more an inhabitable planet. Humans have no choice but to look to the stars for other places for survival. Our hero, who is a former pilot and now a farmer, sets out on this quest with a team of astronauts, leaving behind his family.
The Bad: The first half doesn't feel like a Nolan movie. The panache that appears in his other works, especially the sense of seriousness and hurry, is surprisingly missing. There are long conversations without any background music, that makes you wonder why music composer, Hans Zimmer, who usually goes for the fast beats, has toned down the music so drastically. Parts of the movie feel maudlin, with arguments like ""love is the one thing that transcends space and time"", but the script makes sure that there is someone to counter such arguments with more rational ones, even if the movie doesn't agree with them. The one problem that always existed in Nolan's scripts continues to fester here: characters explaining the plot and the rules to each other, in order to let audience know, even if its obvious that they shouldn't need to explain it to each other. Since this is a movie with esoteric physics concepts at its core, there is a lot of mutual explanation between scientists that doesn't make much sense.
The Good: It does not suffer from one of the biggest problems I feared it would: logical errors. Even though it may seem a little far-fetched, the logic seems sound. Einstein's theories of relativity are extensively exploited, and at times these concepts even elicit emotional responses. The movie also ventures into more opaque fields of theoretical physics, which pique your curiosity to learn more after watching the movie. There are moments such as the spacecraft leaving earth where the music and direction couldn't have been any better. The second half is as gripping as it gets, with scenes interleaving between different spaces and timelines, with numerous challenging but well-crafted scenes, stunning visuals, riveting music, and a couple breathtaking revelations. The robot TARS, with its bare minimum appearance, adds just the right amount of levity to several moments of otherwise monotonous dialogues in the first half. This is one of those movies where every aspect of the film has to be crafted perfectly and put together beautifully in order for it to work and Nolan is just the man for the job. From Hans Zimmer's music to Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography to Matthew McConaughey's acting, there is a perfect conflation of skills to make the movie what it is.
Although people do a lot of nitpicking when it comes to Nolan's movies, the plot of this movie, is scientifically possible, even though highly improbable, and the logic is irreproachable. I've had to ponder for a while to make sense of it all but that's what makes the movie so great, that it leaves you thinking about it long after its over. I will give it a 9 on 10. Must watch.

I watch Astronomy, physics, archeology, geology, even ancient aliens (the latter for the hi-def video of places I can't visit), so if the Nolans didn't do their homework, I would be moaning and groaning right now. I am not, I enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers. I expected hokey black holes and worm holes, but they were just part of the story, didn't get in the way of the great acting, and a dad and his daughter. The music was incredible, as was the cinematography, effects, and writing.

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","Interstellar - Nearly Stellar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3121498/?ref_=tt_urv","If there is one thing that needs to be said about Interstellar it is thisTiny but Massive. There is simply no question that Interstellar is a hugely ambitious film, and similarly there is no question that it is at once an awe inspiring adventure that is epic whilst at the same time remaining poignantly personal. There is also very little question that, a little bit like the wormholes that are described in its plot, on occasions it folds in on itself causing it to fall strangely flat.
Although not a perfect movie and slightly baggy in parts it has to be admired for its sheer scope and vision. Although certain sections make little to no sense (I'm looking at you, the final 20 minutes) and although the film feels too determined at points to resolve everything it has lain out, you will forgive it these minor shortcomings (and they are minor in the grand scheme of the picture) due to its 100 % commitment to the story and the films overall class. It is, despite many critical quibbles, very well scripted for a sci-fi movie, insanely well-paced despite its near 3 hour running time and disgracefully beautiful to watch. The films score is, if a little biblical at times and therefore worldly, pretty sexy too.
Matthew McConaughey puts in a very decent performance considering the sheer scope of his role and the supporting cast is pretty impressive too, although I do feel that Michael Caine's consistent turn in Nolan movies breaks the wall slightly. Thematically the film is about life, recreation and relationships and I felt for a film with no traditional style 'love' interests the visual reinforcement of sex and togetherness in the way that the a lot of the machinery works on the spacecraft (struggling to insert and connect) was nothing short of spectacular. It is here where the film is at its strongest – visually. The simplicity of certain sections are somewhat ruined by the over complicated ending that, when broken down is frustrating and amounts to very little.
All in all however it is films like this that the cinema was made for and although it will naturally be compared to other Nolan films and of course, 2001 & last years Gravity, it is on its own terms that Interstellar works best. These terms are simpleout of this world.","onebigmob1845","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26018350/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2014","8"

"Interstellar","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=tt_urv","2001 Space Odyssey done right","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3147137/?ref_=tt_urv","I personally loved the film. It is an impressionist film, it's about feelings and images, and if you try to analyse individual strokes - the picture falls apart. But so is Metropolis (albeit Metropolis has a much better musical score).
Despite the film shortcomings, of which I will talk extensively, I still give it 10 stars, as it's been a while since a movie would really engage me on some deeper levels.
Of course, there are plot gaps, and the film stumbles, sometimes dragging painfully slow, sometimes rushing through skipping over. But even despite the lack of consistency and attention to writing, it brought me to magical places, and I consider it to be one of the greatest movies I've seen up to date.
Interstellar is evidently inspired by the 2001 Space Odyssey, and I think Christopher Nolan in his attempt perhaps moved one step closer to making some of the ideas that Kubrick expressed more palatable. In case of 2001 Space Odyssey, I appreciate the idea and feeling behind it, but find it excruciatingly painful to endure long minutes of watching one cardboard piece slowly sliding on top of another - especially in this age, where the audience is spoiled by the hyper-realistic CGI renderings.
Just in case one have heightened expectations of the movie, here are things that are 'wrong' about Interstellar, and one should be prepared for it, since the film is not about space at all - it's about human emotions, and also circumstances where our humanity would fall apart and reassemble itself differently.
Interstellar is inherently impressionist and symbolic (like Metropolis), where form and meaning of symbols take precedence over their literal meaning or technical implementation. Interstellar sacrifices a lot. Here are some of the things that are 'wrong' with the film:
Over-exaggerations and often stretched emotions where normal people would behave differently.
Massive plot holes and often lack of reason on behalf of the characters.
Bearable but mediocre musical score
Sketchy and shallow characters, unreasonable immature adults behaving like spoiled teenagers.
Science touches some advanced topics while falling short at basics.
Strictly speaking, the movie is not science fiction. I wish that Christopher Nolan for his next project would involve more mature and qualified people in writing, pay attention to detail and spend more time in making characters more believable - I think by now he can certainly afford it. That being said, in my opinion Interstellar is perhaps his best work up to date, where for me personally it's certainly more important than his other masterpiece 'Dark Knight', as the latter was a form of high quality entertainment, while Interstellar is something to be inspired with.
Speaking of the film score, Hans Zimmer is definitely among my least favourite film composers. He is not a composer at all. A good sound designer at times, but he can't do any music. The loud minimalist score with organ chords, sketchy piano notes and synths at times was reminiscent of 'Also sprach Zarathustra' used in the Kubrik's movie, and that created a certain atmosphere, but the rest of the score, if one would look for a positive word to describe it, is hardly anything more than 'bearable'.","rrtdj","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3105462/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2014","10"
